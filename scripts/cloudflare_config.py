"""Reconcile the Cloudflare Pages project against the state this repo declares.

The blog's Cloudflare setup is not reproducible from `wrangler.toml`: that file only
describes what a *build* would need, and this project is never built by Cloudflare.
Everything that actually shapes the live site (the compatibility date, Smart
Placement, the build image) lives server-side in the project's `deployment_configs`
and is invisible to anyone reading the repository. This module makes that state
explicit, diffable and re-appliable.

Three modes:

    python scripts/cloudflare_config.py --check    # diff live against DESIRED, exit 1 on drift
    python scripts/cloudflare_config.py --apply    # PATCH live to match DESIRED
    python scripts/cloudflare_config.py --dump     # print the live state, secrets redacted

Credentials are resolved in this order, so the same command works in CI and on a
laptop without a token ever being passed on a command line:

    1. `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` from the environment (what CI uses).
    2. The OAuth token `wrangler login` stores locally.

The account is resolved from `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` when set, otherwise from
`GET /accounts` when the credential can see exactly one. No identifier is hardcoded:
this repository is public and account IDs do not belong in it.
