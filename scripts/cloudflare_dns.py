"""Snapshot DNS records, split along the boundary between this blog and everything else.

`kevin.deldycke.com` resolves because of records this repository does not contain, which
makes DNS the one part of a rebuild that cannot be reconstructed from what is committed
here. This script closes that gap without turning a public repository into a map of a
personal network.

Two scopes, because two audiences:

    --scope blog    what belongs in this repository: the `deldycke.com` zone, minus every
                    record that exists to run email. TXT values are fingerprinted.
    --scope full    everything, verbatim, for a private infrastructure knowledge base.

The blog scope is deliberately narrow. Other zones on the same Cloudflare account have
nothing to do with this site, and the mail records on `deldycke.com` describe a mail
provider rather than a website. Neither helps anyone rebuild the blog, and both say more
about their owner than a public repository needs to.

    python scripts/cloudflare_dns.py --write docs/dns.md
    python scripts/cloudflare_dns.py --scope full --write {private}/dns-records.md

The wrangler OAuth token cannot be used: its scope list has no DNS entry at all, and its
`zone:read` covers only the zone objects. Create a token with two read-only permissions
over all domains, then export it as `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` or point `--token-file` at a
file holding it:

    Zone -> Read      to enumerate the zones
    DNS  -> Read      to enumerate each zone's records

Both are needed. `DNS -> Read` alone cannot list zones, so the run fails on the first call
before reading a single record. See docs/infrastructure.md.
