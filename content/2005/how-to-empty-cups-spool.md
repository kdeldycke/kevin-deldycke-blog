Here is a tiny helper script I call regularly by a `cron` job to flush the spool
of my [CUPS server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Unix_Printing_System) as
after several weeks of usage my server end up full of unprinted documents junk:

```sh
#/bin/sh!
service cups stop
rm -f /var/spool/cups/*
rm -f /var/spool/cups/tmp/*
service cups restart
```
