The [v1.0.2 release of
`maildir-deduplicate`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/maildir-deduplicate/1.0.2)
has just been released!

This is the first announcement on my blog of the v1.0.x series, which has been
heavily rewritten during the last past months. The project is now properly
packaged and distributed, and the code is now more idiomatic. There is still
huge work required in this direction, and [contributions are
welcome](https://github.com/kdeldycke/maildir-deduplicate)!
