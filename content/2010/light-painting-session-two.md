Here is another light painting session I've done 2 weeks ago with Jim:

This time we used a more powerfull light source: a simple [Apple's iPhone](https://amzn.com/B001AXA056/?tag=kevideld-20) at full brightness.

We also played with several colors, thanks to the [free Flashlight app](https://itunes.apple.com/app/flashlight/id285281827).

Check out the entire set of photos on his photo gallery.
