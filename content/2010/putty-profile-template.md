Inspired by a recent friend's post about an [annoying PuTTY behavior (fix included)](https://www.think-underground.com/post/2010/04/13/Supprimer-le-comportement-%C3%A9trange-du-pav%C3%A9-num%C3%A9rique-dans-Putty), here is [my template for PuTTY profiles]({attach}putty-template.reg).

It's just a slightly modified version of [Ilya Grigorik's "Desert" color theme](https://www.igvita.com/2008/04/14/custom-putty-color-themes/), with some tweaks that suit my needs.
