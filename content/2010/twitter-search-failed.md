Had an issue with [ÃœberCart](https://www.ubercart.org/) tonight.

Was sure I already solved it.

Knew I explained the solution on Twitter.

Tried to [search for it](https://search.twitter.com/search?q=ubercart+from%3Akdeldycke):

![]({attach}failed-twitter-search.png)

and failed!

And all I was looking for was [this little tweet](https://twitter.com/kdeldycke/status/1508913388).

Is [Twitter's search](https://search.twitter.com) supposed to work? :(
