[Quartz Composer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_Composer) is a really
nice piece of software for [visualists](https://createdigitalmotion.com). It
allows you to create animated and/or interactive compositions mixing sounds,
images, effects, user inputs and any other kind of data. In fact, Quartz
Composer was the main reason I bought a
[MacBook Pro](https://amzn.com/B002QQ8H8I/?tag=kevideld-20) 18 months ago.

The first composition I created was this simple kaleidoscopic effect with
shifting colors:

The [source composition
]({attach}kaleidoscope-000.qtz) is available under
a [Creative Commons 3.0 BY-SA license
](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/). And here is the screenshot
of the main patch:

And this is how I designed the color wheel sub-patch:

If creating a composition is really simple and straightforward, exporting the
result to a video file is another story...

I first tried the [Export to Movie
](https://quartzcomposer.com/plugins/1-export-to-movie) v1.3b plugin. But it
didn't worked on my [Mac OS X Snow Leopard
](https://amzn.com/B001AMHWP8/?tag=kevideld-20), throwing me this exception
every time:

So I tried the old trick of [importing compositions in iMovie
](https://blogs.ipona.com/james/archive/2005/05/05/1040.aspx). If this was
possible in the past with [iMovie](https://amzn.com/B003XKRZES/?tag=kevideld-20)
'06, [Apple removed this feature in iMovie '09
](https://www.quartzcompositions.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=594).

My last chance was another plugin: [Movie Exporter
](https://quartzcomposer.com/plugins/6-movie-exporter) (`v0.0.20091011`). As the
other one, you have to drop your original composition in a _Render in Image_
macro block and export the resulting stream to the _Movie Exporter_ block:

![]({attach}movie-exporter-patch.png)

It did the trick but it looked like I messed things up: my goal was to export a
720p clip. But compression artifacts are so present in the final video that I
think the exported images are blow-ups of a rendering executed at a much lower
resolution. The rendering in the preview panel support this hypothesis:

![]({attach}kaleidoscope-viewer.png)

Another big problem with this video export lies in the framerate: it cannot be
set. For this composition the plugin exported a clip at 11fps. Which is far
from fluid. I guess it's because of the plugin grabbing images in real-time
instead of taking the necessary time to render them one by one.

At the end, because of the reduced number of options available to export QC's
compositions to movies, and because of the proprietary nature of the platform,
I don't want to invest more time and energy in Quartz Composer.

I did some more experiments with it last year. I plan to share them with you
and published them in the coming weeks. Then I'll be free to sell my Apple
machine and switch back to a full Open-Source stack (I'm thinking of
[Processing](https://processing.org),
[PureData](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data) and their derivates here).
