Last week I needed a local IMAP server on Mac OS X Leopard for temporary
testing. After struggling with [courier-imap](https://www.courier-mta.org/imap/)
for hours, I've finally settled on [Dovecot](https://www.dovecot.org/). You'll
see below how easy it is to install and configure it.

We're lucky, [Dovecot is available in MacPorts
](https://www.macports.org/ports.php?by=name&substr=dovecot), so we can install
it easily:

```shell-session
$ port install dovecot
```

It's time to configure it. We start with the default configuration template:

```shell-session
$ cp /opt/local/etc/dovecot/dovecot-example.conf /opt/local/etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf
```

Then we can edit the `dovecot.conf` configuration file as we wish. FYI, here
are my modifications:

```

Before starting Dovecot, we have to create a dummy SSL certificate:

```shell-session
$ mkdir -p /opt/local/etc/ssl/{certs,private}
$ openssl req -new -x509 -days 3650 -nodes -out /opt/local/etc/ssl/certs/dovecot.pem -keyout /opt/local/etc/ssl/private/dovecot.pem
```

And finally, we can launch the Dovecot server itself as `root`:

```shell-session
$ dovecot
```

That's all!

You can now access your local IMAP server with any client. Here is an example
with [Thunderbird](https://www.mozillamessaging.com/thunderbird/):

And if you have problems, the first reflex is to read Dovecot's logs:

```shell-session
$ tail -F /var/log/mail.log
```
