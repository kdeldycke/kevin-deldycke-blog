Here is an optical illusion I generated with [Inkscape](https://www.inkscape.org). I created this file some years ago and found it recently while cleaning my archives.

Using a contrast trick it appears that [circles are in motions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_illusion). Click on the image below to get a full-size preview:

Unfortunately I lost the original SVG source file (`optical-illusion-circles-in-motion.svgz`). But I was able to recover the original PNG file.
