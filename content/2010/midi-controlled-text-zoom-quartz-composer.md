![]({attach}midi-controller-preview.jpg)

To end my [series of experimentations with Quartz
Composer]({tag}quartz-composer) that I [started 2 months
ago]({filename}/2010/export-quartz-composer-video.md), here is
my last patch:

![]({attach}patch-of-midi-controlled-text-zoom-in-quartz-composer.png)

It's [based on the previous
one]({filename}/2010/quartz-composer-behringer-bcf-2000-midi-controller-tests.md)
and is also driven by a [Berhinger BCF-2000 MIDI
controller](https://amzn.com/B000CZ0RJ2/?tag=kevideld-20). The purpose of this
composition is to zoom a piece of text, give it some kind of velocity and
change its color. Again, nothing fancy here: it's just a simple patch, which
[source is available for
download]({attach}text-zoom-in-out.qtz).

As for the last time, I recorded a little demo to practice my new videomaking
skills (and to find a justification for buying more video gear ;) ):
