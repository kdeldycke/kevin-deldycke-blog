Here is an unedited video of
[Le Duc](https://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=20312134675), a band I shot last
week at [Happy Farm Fest 2010](https://happyfarmfest.com) with my
[Canon 7D](https://amzn.com/B002NEGTTW/?tag=kevideld-20) and a
[Sigma 30mm f/1.4 EX DC HSM](https://amzn.com/B0007U0GZM/?tag=kevideld-20) wide

This was shot in 1080p at 25 fps (to reduce light flickering) without any
stabilization device. I may have use my
[LCD ViewFinder](https://amzn.com/B003A2BU5E/?tag=kevideld-20) but I have no
clear memory of this. Shutter speed was 1/50 and ISO set to auto.

I'm shooting video with my 7D for 7 months now and I think that's the first time
one of my shot is made public. That's quite depressing as I still have tons of
raw video to edit for several projects, but can't go ahead because of a
[bad MacBook Pro]({filename}/2009/macosx-is-irritating.md#update-june-2010)...
