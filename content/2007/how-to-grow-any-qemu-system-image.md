Qemu images can't be growed. In this example I will show you a little hack to grow a 6GiB `qcow` image to a 10GiB image. Beware: these operations can take a lot of time to perform and require lots of free space.

First, convert your `qcow` image to a plain raw file:

```shell-session
$ qemu-img convert system.qcow -O raw system.raw
```

Then, create a dummy file (filled with zeros) of the size of extra space you want to add to your image. In this case, 4GiB (=10GiB - 6GiB):

```shell-session
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=zeros.raw bs=1024k count=4096
```

Fearlessly, add your extra space to your raw system image:

```shell-session
$ cat system.raw zeros.raw > big10G.raw
```

After that you can boot qemu to verify that added free space is available:

```shell-session
$ qemu -hda big10G.raw
```

Here is an real case example of what you can see in a qemu image on which Windows XP was installed:

![]({attach}growed-image1.png)

Now, to grow your primary partition, I suggest you to download a Live CD like [gparted Live CD](https://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php) or [System Rescue CD](https://www.sysresccd.org), and boot on the `.iso` file with qemu:

```shell-session
$ qemu -hda big10G.raw -cdrom gparted-livecd-0.3.4-5.iso -boot d
```

This will allow you to grow and manipulate all your partitions safely thanks to [parted](https://www.gnu.org/software/parted/index.shtml) and other open source system tools.

Finally you can convert back your `raw` image to a `qcow` one to not waste space:

```shell-session
$ qemu-img convert big10G.raw -O qcow growed-system.qcow
```

That's all!

By the way, I think it's possible to perform the second and third step of this how-to in a single operation using `dd` only.

_Update_: I missed it, but this issue is also described in the FAQ from the [unofficial #qemu wiki](https://kidsquid.com/cgi-bin/moin.cgi) (look at "[How do I resize a disk image?](https://kidsquid.com/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#head-b46370d3ad030e6c1712338f0e5112228c51212a)" question).
