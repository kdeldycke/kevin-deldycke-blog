Here is a tiny article about how I used [Lighttpd](https://www.lighttpd.net) to
serve content over [WebDAV](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV).

First, install the required packages:

```shell-session
$ aptitude install lighttpd-mod-webdav
```

As we want to provide a secure WebDAV access, we need to install
[OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org):

```shell-session
$ aptitude install openssl
```

Then we create the file `/etc/lighttpd/clear-creds.lst`, that will contain
credentials required for authentication, under the following form:

```text
user1:password1
user2:password2
user3:password3
```

Logins and passwords are stored here in clear. This is stupid, but for this
project I was looking to setup a quick and dirty server. For temporary tests
this setup is OK, but I encourage you to switch to a better credential storage
system.

Now I want to serve WebDAV content within a secure channel. A self-signed SSL
certificate will be enough. Let's generate one:

```shell-session
$ cd /etc/lighttpd/
$ openssl req -x509 -nodes -subj '/' -days 3650 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout server.pem -out server.pem
```

We'll configure Lighttpd by loading the default parameters of modules we use:

```shell-session
$ cd /etc/lighttpd/conf-enabled/
$ ln -s ../conf-available/05-auth.log
$ ln -s ../conf-available/10-ssl.conf
$ ln -s ../conf-available/10-webdav.conf
```

Now I create a custom configuration file:

```shell-session
$ touch /etc/lighttpd/conf-available/99-custom.conf
$ cd /etc/lighttpd/conf-enabled/
$ ln -s ../conf-available/99-custom.conf
```

Here is the content of that `99-custom.conf` configuration file:

```lighttpd
# Hide server version
server.tag = "lighttpd"

# Force all request to be in HTTPs
# This also redirects all WebDAV requests to WebDAVs
$HTTP["scheme"] == "http" {
  $HTTP["host"] =~ "(.*)" {
    url.redirect = ( "^/(.*)" => "https://%1/$1" )
  }
}

# Valid credentials are required for any request
auth.backend = "plain"
auth.backend.plain.userfile = "/etc/lighttpd/clear-creds.lst"
auth.require = (
  "/" => (
    "method" => "digest",
    "realm" => "My WebDAV server",
    "require" => "valid-user"
  )
)

# Enable WebDAV in read and write mode
webdav.activate = "enable"
webdav.is-readonly = "disable"

# Customize directory listings a bit
dir-listing.set-footer = "<a href='https://example.com'>Company</a>'s document repository."
```

And do not forget to restart the server:

```shell-session
$ /etc/init.d/lighttpd restart
```

As you can see in the screenshot above, you can now:

- Browse the file system in read/write mode with a WebDAV client via a
  `webdavs://12.34.56.78/` URL;
- Access content in read-only mode with a browser by a classic
  `https://12.34.56.78/` URL.
