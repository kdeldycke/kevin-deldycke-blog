Some weeks ago I was at a local bar to see [Trapped in Freedom](https://www.myspace.com/trappedinfreedom). This band is composed of friends, and is also a side project involving [Jimy Wong](https://coolcavemen.com/biography/jimy-wong/) from [Cool Cavemen](https://coolcavemen.com), again as a drummer. This was a perfect excuse to test my brand new [Tamron SP AF 17-50mm f/2.8 XR Di-II VC LD IF lens](https://amzn.com/B002LVUIXA/?tag=kevideld-20). 



Some days after shooting I sent my raw footages to the band, which decided to publish a preview of their song "Chicken Fighter" on YouTube. Here is the video:

They also released "Incoming" some days ago:

All of these were shots in 1080p at 23.976 fps with a shutter speed of 1/50. Lens was set to manual focus as usual, and stayed wide open at f/2.8, with optical stabilization ("VC" in Tamron's jargon) on.

I think the white balance was set to tungsten. I don't remember what was the ISO setting. Maybe set to automatic. I really don't remember. Should have drink less. Either that or changing my video workflow. After all, keeping these `.THM` files is a good idea, as these contain the video metadatas that can't be put in the `.MOV` files produced by Canon.

Finally, if the music is good, the sound is awful as it was captured without any special care, with the embedded camera microphone. Now I really have to invest money and time to upgrade my sound recording gear and skills. [Canon EOS 7D](https://amzn.com/B002NEGTTW/?tag=kevideld-20)'s Automatic Gain Control (AGC) really starts to be limiting (pun intended)...
