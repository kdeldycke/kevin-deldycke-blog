Installing [APC](https://php.net/manual/en/book.apc.php) on Debian Squeeze is
as simple as installing the package:

```shell-session
$ aptitude install php5-apc
```

In my case this package come from the PHP bundle distributed by the [Dotdeb
repository](https://www.dotdeb.org).

If installing APC is easy, monitoring it with Munin requires some extra
manipulations. There is currently no good [APC plugin available on Munin
Exhange](https://exchange.munin-monitoring.org/plugins/search?keyword=apc). So
we'll use the external [munin-php-apc
project](https://code.google.com/p/munin-php-apc/) instead.

The latter can't get APC statistics by itself: it need an extra PHP file to be
served locally. As you can read in my previous article, [my Munin is powered by
Nginx]({filename}/2011/munin-monitor-debian-squeeze-server.md).
So now we'll setup Nginx to serve this extra PHP file:

```shell-session
$ mkdir -p /var/www/apc
$ cd /var/www/apc
$ wget https://munin-php-apc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/php_apc/apc_info.php
$ chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/apc
```

Then I need to update my `/etc/nginx/sites-available/munin` file (see [details
about this file on my previous
article]({filename}/2011/munin-monitor-debian-squeeze-server.md))
to have the second `server` section look like this:

```nginx
server {
  server_name localhost;
  include /etc/nginx/php.conf;
  root /var/www/apc;
  allow 127.0.0.1;
  deny all;
  location / {
    access_log off;
  }
  location /nginx_status {
    stub_status on;
    access_log off;
  }
}
```

Here the included `/etc/nginx/php.conf` file is the one in which I've
concentrate all the Nginx directives required to activate PHP file parsing. The
content and the mechanism behind this file is describe in my [article on
setting up Nginx with
PHP-FPM]({filename}/2011/nginx-php-fpm-mysql-debian-squeeze-server.md).

Let's get back to our Munin monitoring setup. I can restart now Nginx and check
that I can access locally to my raw statistics:

```shell-session
$ /etc/init.d/nginx reload
$ wget http://localhost/apc_info.php
$ wget http://localhost/nginx_status
```

The last step is to install and configure the Munin plugin:

```shell-session
$ aptitude install libwww-perl
$ wget https://munin-php-apc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/php_apc/php_apc_ --output-document=/usr/share/munin/plugins/php_apc_
$ chmod -R 755 /usr/share/munin/plugins/
$ ln -s /usr/share/munin/plugins/php_apc_ /etc/munin/plugins/php_apc_usage
$ ln -s /usr/share/munin/plugins/php_apc_ /etc/munin/plugins/php_apc_hit_miss
$ ln -s /usr/share/munin/plugins/php_apc_ /etc/munin/plugins/php_apc_purge
$ ln -s /usr/share/munin/plugins/php_apc_ /etc/munin/plugins/php_apc_fragmentation
$ ln -s /usr/share/munin/plugins/php_apc_ /etc/munin/plugins/php_apc_files
$ ln -s /usr/share/munin/plugins/php_apc_ /etc/munin/plugins/php_apc_rates
$ echo "[php_apc_*]
user root
env.url http://localhost/apc_info.php?auto
" > /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/php_apc
$ /etc/init.d/munin-node restart
```

And finally, after a while, you'll get those beautiful graphs:
