After
[3 years in limbo](https://kevin.deldycke.com/2008/01/e107-to-wordpress-migration-v09-plug-in-released/),
here is a new stable version of my e107 Importer plugin for WordPress, proudly
numbered 1.0! :)

This is the first time this plugin is
[available on the official WordPress plugin repository](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/e107-importer/).
This means easy upgrades for you! :)

I've heavily updated the plugin to use the latest WordPress import framework, so
everything is now cleanly integrated.

This version was tested with [e107 v0.7.24](https://e107.org/news.php?item.877)
and
[WordPress 3.1-RC3](https://wordpress.org/news/2011/01/wordpress-3-1-release-candidate-3/).

Here is the changelog:

  * Upgrade e107 code from [e107 v0.7.24](https://e107.org/news.php?item.877).
  * Minimal requirement set to WordPress 3.0.0.
  * Use new WordPress importer framework.
  * Add an e107 to WordPress 301 redirector plugin (support news, pages, users
    and feeds).
  * Disable the URL rewriting feature
    [introduced in v0.9](https://kevin.deldycke.com/2008/01/e107-to-wordpress-migration-v09-plug-in-released/).
  * Make image import optional.
  * Add an option to upload images from allowed domains only.
  * Align naming conventions with other WordPress importer.
  * Add a complete WordPress plugin hosting compatible
    [readme file](https://github.com/kdeldycke/e107-importer/blob/master/readme.txt) with full metadatas.
  * Add
    [screenshots](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/e107-importer/screenshots/).
  * List all
    [versions of e107 and WordPress I tested this plugin with](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/e107-importer/other_notes/).
  * Add a
    [PayPal donation link](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=XEXREDEHXSQUJ).
  * Add a minimal [FAQ](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/e107-importer/faq/).
  * Add an overview of features in description.
  * Update [source code repository](https://github.com/kdeldycke/e107-importer)
    location.
  * Remove patching of Kubrick theme to support comments on static pages.

A note for developpers: the
[reference code base](https://github.com/kdeldycke/e107-importer) is now located
on GitHub. That's were all new code must be committed.
[WordPress' Subversion repository](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/e107-importer/)
is only a mirror.

If any question,
[please read the FAQ first](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/e107-importer/faq/).
