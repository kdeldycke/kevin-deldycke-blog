I've just made the specific design of the blog you're currently reading into a generic theme for [Pelican](https://getpelican.com). This theme now has a name: [Plumage](https://github.com/kdeldycke/plumage).

It also has its own [dedicated repository](https://github.com/kdeldycke/plumage) on GitHub. You're actively encouraged to fork it and contribute back code through pull requests.

The 0.2 version just released is the first that is generic enough to be used on any Pelican's site. I plan to incrementally add some improvements over the next few months, but right now it's good enough to be [part of](https://twitter.com/getpelican/status/355025140112822272) the [Pelican's themes repository](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes).
