6 months ago I gave 100â‚¬ to [La Quadrature du Net](https://www.laquadrature.net). It's an advocacy group defending the rights and freedoms of citizens on the Internet. Its reputation is well established and its actions are internationally recognized by the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) and the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/).

They didn't reached their fundraising goal last year, but it doesn't matter: [donation](https://support.laquadrature.net/) are accepted all year long. If you care about your rights & freedom in a digital society, you should [contribute](https://support.laquadrature.net/).

As a gift, you'll received decimals of Pi:
