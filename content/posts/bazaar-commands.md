  * Check-out in the local `openerp-server` folder the `6.0` branch of the OpenERP server project from Launchpad:

        :::shell-session
        $ bzr branch lp:openobject-server/6.0 openerp-server

  * Same command as above, but fetch a particular revision:

        :::shell-session
        $ bzr branch lp:openobject-server/6.0 -r 3425 openerp-server

  * Check-out the current head of a branch, without its history. This is particularly useful when working on large repositories with huge history ([source](https://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/beta/en/user-guide/using_checkouts.html#getting-a-lightweight-checkout)):

        :::shell-session
        $ bzr checkout --lightweight lp:openobject-addons/7.0 addons

  * Export a copy of a branch, without any Bazaar metadata:

        :::shell-session
        $ bzr export addons lp:openobject-addons/7.0

  * Get revision number of the local copy we sit in:

        :::shell-session
        $ bzr revno ./

  * Change the repository to a previous revision:

        :::shell-session
        $ bzr revert -r 1234

  * Remove lock file on the current repository:

        :::shell-session
        $ bzr break-lock

  * Produce a patch from uncommited local changes with absolute path:

        :::shell-session
        $ bzr diff --prefix=`pwd`/:`pwd`/ > server.patch
