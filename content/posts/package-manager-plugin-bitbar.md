I just released [Package Manager v1.0
](https://getbitbar.com/plugins/Dev/PackageManager/package_manager.7h.py), a plugin
for [BitBar](https://getbitbar.com/), which centralize both [Homebrew
](http://brew.sh/) and [Cask](https://caskroom.github.io/) available updates
under a unique menu entry:

The plugin, which [started its life
](https://github.com/kdeldycke/dotfiles/blob/master/dotfiles-osx/.bitbar/package_manager.7h.py)
with my dotfiles, [now lives
](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar-plugins/blob/master/Dev/PackageManager/package_manager.7h.py)
in the official BitBar plugins repository.
