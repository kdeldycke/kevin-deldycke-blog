I've build a RPM package of [Rugg](http://rugg.sourceforge.net) for Mandriva 2006. I also added [a source-rpm repository for Mandriva 2006.0](http://github.com/kdeldycke/mandriva-specs) on this site.

Rugg describe itself as a "Flexible file system and hard drive crash testing". Take a look on the official project website for details: [Rugg Project website](http://rugg.sourceforge.net).
