For several weeks, I started a quest to find the best solution to locally backup a Gmail account.

I [tried `offline-imap`](https://kevin.deldycke.com/2012/05/backup-gmail-offlineimap/), but it is bidirectional and can push back to your Gmail account local mistakes. Then I [played with `mbsync`](https://kevin.deldycke.com/2012/08/gmail-backup-mbsync/), but it [doesn't support sub-folders/tags](https://www.mail-archive.com/isync-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg00220.html).

I finally found the Holy Grail in [Gmvault](https://gmvault.org/), a recent open-source project especially designed for the task and all its subtleties.

To install it on Ubuntu, starts by getting [distribute](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute), a Python dependency:

    ```shell-session
    $ sudo pip install --upgrade distribute
    Downloading/unpacking distribute
      Running setup.py egg_info for package distribute
    Installing collected packages: distribute
      Found existing installation: distribute 0.6.24dev-r0
        Uninstalling distribute:
          Successfully uninstalled distribute
      Running setup.py install for distribute
        Before install bootstrap.
        Scanning installed packages
        Setuptools installation detected at /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
        Non-egg installation
        Removing elements out of the way...
        Already patched.

        Creating /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/setuptools.pth
    Successfully installed distribute
    Cleaning up...
    ```

Then install Gmvault itself:

    ```

Now [for authentication, please read the documentation](https://gmvault.org/in_depth.html#authentication). It's quite easy and straightforward.

Finally, to start the backup of your remote Gmail account, just launch:

    ```shell-session
    $ gmvault sync me@example.com --resume
    ```

All you have to do next is to put the command above in a cron job to trigger a regular backup.
