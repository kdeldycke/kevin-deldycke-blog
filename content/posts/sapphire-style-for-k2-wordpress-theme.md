![Sapphire custom style for K2 Wordpress Theme](/uploads/2007/k2-sapphire.png)

Yesterday I've build a new
[K2](https://web.archive.org/web/20150107112837/http://getk2.com/about/) style
based on
[the legacy Sapphire 1.0 Wordpress theme](https://web.archive.org/web/20071001205059/http://www.michaelmartine.com/free-wordpress-themes/free-wordpress-theme-sapphire/)
by [Michael Martine](https://web.archive.org/web/20071002094737/http://www.michaelmartine.com/about-michael-martine-helping-bloggers/). This is the result of my
love to the blue bend of Sapphire and the versatility of K2.

As you can see in the footer of that blog, I'm using my Sapphire 0.1 style right
now. So if you like the look and feel of that blog, don't ask yourself and
[download Sapphire 0.1 for for K2](https://github.com/kdeldycke/sapphire/archive/sapphire-0.1.zip)!

To install it, unzip the archive to your `/wp-content/themes/k2/styles/` folder.
