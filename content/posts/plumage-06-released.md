After more than a year in stasis, I just released both version 0.5 and version
0.6  of my [Plumage theme](https://github.com/kdeldycke/plumage) for Pelican.

Why the sudden burst of activity you might ask? Well, I noticed during last
months that some fellow *Pelican-ista* were still using my theme. And I
realized that some odd rendering bugs that I tough was just affecting me were
in fact widespread. I found the time to finally squashed them and they're now
fixed in this latest releases.

I you are still using Plumage, it's time to upgrade!
