WordPress default theme, [TwentyEleven](https://theme.wordpress.com/themes/twentyeleven/), has a built-in [showcase mode](https://twentyelevendemo.wordpress.com/showcase/) that is displaying a set a slides (composed of sticky posts) at the top of a page. This mode can be activated by creating a static page and set its _Template_ page attribute to _Showcase Template_.

The problem with this mode to me was the lack of an auto-advance feature that will cycle through the slides every X seconds. Luckily I [found a way](https://pastebin.com/s6JEthVi) to automate implement this with some lines of JavaScript:

    ```html
    <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">
      // Auto-advance the showcase slider
      // Source: https://pastebin.com/s6JEthVi
      jQuery(document).ready(function(){
        var change_every = 5; // The number of seconds that the slider will auto-advance in
        var current = 1;
        function auto_advance(){
          if(current == -1) return false;
          jQuery('.feature-slider a').eq(current % jQuery('.feature-slider a').length).trigger('click', [true]);
          current++;
        };
        setInterval(function(){auto_advance()}, change_every * 1000);
      });
    </script>
    ```

All you have to do is to embed this snippet of code within your home page. It could either be in the static page you use as a showcase template or in a showcase widget. The latter is the exact same method I used earlier that year to [customize CSS in WordPress without messing with the original code](https://kevin.deldycke.com/2011/01/new-blog-header-and-tiny-wordpress-theme-customizations/).

And of course this code is currently live at the front page of that very blog.
