Last month I had no other alternative but to reach a server through a [Check Point](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_Point)'s VPN. Fortunately the editor provides a Linux client to access its proprietary stack.

The version I found to work on my Ubuntu 11.04 is the _SSL Network Extender (SNX) R71_ package that [can be downloaded there](http://supportcontent.checkpoint.com/file_download?id=10656)  ([source](https://supportcenter.checkpoint.com/supportcenter/portal?eventSubmit_doGoviewsolutiondetails=&solutionid=sk41808)).

Just for reference, the build working for me is numbered `800005013`, and here is a copy of what to expect when the connection succeed:

    :::bash
    $ snx -s vpn.example.net -u my_user
    Check Point's Linux SNX
    build 800005013
    Please enter your password:

    SNX - connected.

    Session parameters:
    ===================
    Office Mode IP      : 10.32.10.23
    DNS Server          : 10.168.10.1
    Secondary DNS Server: 10.168.10.2
    Timeout             : 3 hours
