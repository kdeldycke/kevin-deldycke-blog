For some months, [I own a Samsung Q35 laptop](http://kevin.deldycke.com/2006/10/samsung-q35-xic-5500-tiny-review-of-a-strong-compact-laptop/) which is powered by a Mandriva 2007.0.

As describe in its technical specification this machine include an [Intel GMA 950 GPU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_GMA#GMA_950). `lspci` give us more details:

    00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Mobile 945GM/PM/GMS, 943/940GML and 945GT Express Memory Controller Hub (rev 03)
    00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Mobile 945GM/GMS, 943/940GML Express Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 03)
    00:02.1 Display controller: Intel Corporation Mobile 945GM/GMS, 943/940GML Express Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 03)

This chipset is recognized out of the box by `drakconf` and thanks to this GUI, I was able to setup X.org with [AIGLX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIGLX) in no more than 2 clicks !

Here are some screenshots of the resulting 3D desktop:

As you can see there is still some bugs but I had to test many softwares to find one which had problems with the 3D desktop. Except [Celestia](http://www.shatters.net/celestia), everything was working as usual. Beside this, I just had to redefine some shotcuts in [Compiz](http://compiz.org) (to match the default KDE shortcuts) and I was feeling at home ! :)
