After [migrating from WordPress to Pelican](https://kevin.deldycke.com/2013/02/wordpress-to-pelican/), I realized that my old Mandriva repositories weighted 1.3 Go. Which make my whole blog much bigger than I expected. So I decided to trim the fat and moved my repositories in retirement.

This post is a formal announcement that my repositories, formerly available at `https://kevin.deldycke.com/static/repository/mandriva/`, are now gone forever.

Mandriva is no longer popular and I doubt there is people out there still using any version from 2006.0 to 2009.1. Nobody will regret my packages. And if for any reason you do, I've put an [archive of all RPM's sources on GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/mandriva-specs).
