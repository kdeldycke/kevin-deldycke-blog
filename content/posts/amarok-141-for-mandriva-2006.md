Today I've successfully backported the last stable version of Amarok from cooker to Mandriva 2006. You can find the [Amarok 1.4.1 RPM packages in my repository](http://github.com/kdeldycke/mandriva-specs).

Beside Amarok, you'll find there other packages like [libvisual](http://localhost.nl/~synap/libvisual) v0.4, [libgpod](http://www.gtkpod.org/libgpod.html) v0.3.2 which are required by this latest release of Amarok to work properly.

To [install packages from my repository, take a look at my previous posts](http://kevin.deldycke.com/2006/04/new-repository-for-mandriva-2006/).
