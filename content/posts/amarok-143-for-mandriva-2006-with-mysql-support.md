title: Amarok 1.4.3 for Mandriva 2006 with MySQL support
tags: Amarok, KDE, Linux, Mandriva, Music, MySQL, SQL, RPM

[Amarok 1.4.3 is out](http://amarok.kde.org/content/view/81/66/) ! Here are the [brand new packages for Mandriva 2006](http://github.com/kdeldycke/mandriva-specs). This version of Amarok is a backport from the cooker repository and is built to work with KDE 3.4.2 (which is the default version that came with the free download edition of Mandriva 2006). I've also added in my repository all the missing depencies: [TunePimp](http://musicbrainz.org/products/tunepimp/index.html) 0.4.2, [libmtp](http://libmtp.sourceforge.net) and libofa0.

As requested by some peoples in my [previous release](http://kevin.deldycke.com/2006/08/amarok-142-final-for-mandriva-2006/), the MySQL support was missing. I've just added it for this 1.4.3 version. Please leave a comment to let me know if it work (or not), because I don't use this feature myself.

As usual, take a look at [previous release post and comments about Amarok](http://kevin.deldycke.com/category/amarok/) if you experienced problems. There you will be able to get some tips.
