title: Amarok 1.4.2-beta1 for Mandriva 2006
tags: Amarok, KDE, Linux, Mandriva, Music, RPM

The [first beta of amarok 1.4.2](http://amarok.kde.org/content/view/77) was out for about 2 weeks and today I backported it to Mandriva 2006. This new version is the first to include the [Advanced Tag Features (ATF) system](http://amarok.kde.org/amarokwiki/index.php/ATF) which is perfect for people with big and constantly evolving music collection.

[Here are the RPMs](http://github.com/kdeldycke/mandriva-specs)

If you have some issue with this release, take a look at [comments of previous versions](http://kevin.deldycke.com/2006/07/amarok-141-for-mandriva-2006/) and my "[You installed Amarok from my RPMs and can’t play some files ? Here is the fix...](http://kevin.deldycke.com/2006/08/you-installed-amarok-from-my-rpms-and-you-cant-play-some-files-here-is-the-fix/)" post.
