title: e107 to Wordpress Migration: Here is Why.
tags: akismet, Blog, CMS, e107, spam, Web, WordPress

As you probably don't know, I'm the webmaster (this word sounds so 90's...) of [the Cool Cavemen Band website](http://coolcavemen.com), which is [powered by e107 Content Managment System](http://www.e107.org). Unfortunately we started some months ago to get lots of [comment spams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comment_spam) (at least 10 per day), and [the number of them keeps increasing](http://coolcavemen.com/news.php?item.82). Another site I host and manage, [Maomium](http://maomium.com), is [also invaded by spammers](http://maomium.com/news.php?item.43).

Beside this, I run this blog, powered by [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org), since april '06 and thanks to the [Akismet anti-spam plug-in](http://www.akismet.com), my comments are free of viagra and porn links. To get the benefits of such a plug-in, I decided to... write an Akismet plug-in for e107... migrate from e107 to Wordpress.

Akismet was the main reason, but here are the 3 others:

  * Wordpress has [friendly URLs](http://tallecreative.com/designmudd/2005/07/06/wordpress-search-engine-friendly-urls/), which is great from a search engine optimisation point of view;

  * Wordpress has [XML-RPC ping](http://codex.wordpress.org/Update_Services), to publish posts to popular sites like [Feed Burner](http://www.feedburner.com), [Feedster](http://www.feedster.com), [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com) and [much more](http://pingomatic.com/) (= faster and easier content spreading through the net);

  * Wordpress community is bigger, than the e107 one, which mean more plugins, more themes, bigger dynamics regarding code and security updates.

By doing this migration, I expect to have :

  * a spam free site,
  * well-indexed content,
  * a better spreading of Cool Cavemen's news and activities.

On the other hand, this migration make me loose some features :

  * Forums
  * Image Gallery
  * Newsletters
  * Event Calendar

Even if those features are not built-in in Wordpress, I expect to find some plug-ins to fill the gap (I'll probably post the result of my investigations on that blog).

To conclude, I would like to thanks the whole e107 team for their impressive and hard work. I would also like to thank members of the e107 community who helped me to resolve bugs and problems. I enjoyed my 2 years as e107 user, but my needs changed and to reflects this I had to change softwares too. Sorry e107 !
