Last night, I was going back home from a photo trip with friends, when I spotted a film crew on [Alexander III bridge in Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pont_Alexandre_III). It happened to be the shooting of some scenes for the next Woody Allen movie: [Midnight in Paris](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1605783/).

Here are some noisy photos I've taken with my [Canon 7D](https://amzn.com/B002NEGTTW/?tag=kevideld-20) and a [15-85mm f/3.5-5.6](https://amzn.com/B002NEGTTM/?tag=kevideld-20). If only I had a [fast telephoto lens](https://amzn.com/B0000ALKBU/?tag=kevideld-20)... :(
