Since the beginning of this blog, my collection of python scripts were not readable. This was due to the fact that files with `.py` extension are seen by the apache web server as CGI scripts. To tell apache that python files can be published as-is, put a `.htaccess` beside your files. Then edit it to add the following directive:

    :::apache
    RemoveHandler .py

That's all! This will let apache serve `.py` files as normal plain text files. [More info about RemoveHandler](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_mime.html.en#removehandler) can be found in official apache documentation.
