I've just got 2 coupons from [iFixit](http://www.ifixit.com/Parts-Store). They'll give you $5 off on your next purchase. As I plan to get rid off of all my Apple hardware very soon, I don't need them anymore.

If you want one, please leave a comment below and don't forget to fill the appropriate field with your email. I'll then be able to contact you and send you the coupon's code.
