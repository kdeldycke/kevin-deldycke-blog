My home server is protected by an [MGE Ellipse 750 UPS](http://www.mgeops.com/index.php/products__1/230v_products/ups/ellipse_asr) for years. I bought it for several reasons: it's affordable, has good capacity and is Ubuntu certified.

I also read back then [rumors](http://blog.mansonthomas.com/2008/10/setting-up-ups-link-with-ubuntu-server.html) implying that Nut's maintainer was employed by MGE. Having a hardware manufacturer employing a fellow open-source hacker has certainly influenced my purchase decision.

MGE is no more and has been [merged with EATON](http://www.eaton.com/Eaton/OurCompany/NewsEvents/NewsReleases/CT_136576). But my UPS is still supported, and the release of Debian Squeeze is a good opportunity to consolidate my knowledge in the form of this tutorial.

So here is how I setup Nut on Debian Squeeze to monitor my UPS.

First things first, we have to install the main package and its USB driver:

    :::bash
    $ aptitude install nut nut-usb

Now let's configure Nut and run it:

    :::bash
    $ sed -i 's/MODE=none/MODE=standalone/g' /etc/nut/nut.conf
    $ echo '
    [MGE-Ellipse750]
    driver = usbhid-ups
    port = auto
    desc = "MGE UPS Systems"
    ' >> /etc/nut/ups.conf
    $ sed -i 's/# LISTEN 127\.0\.0\.1 3493/LISTEN 127\.0\.0\.1/g' /etc/nut/upsd.conf
    $ echo '
    [kevin]
    password = badpassword
    upsmon master
    ' >> /etc/nut/upsd.users
    $ sed -i 's/# NOTIFYCMD \/usr\/local\/ups\/bin\/notifyme/NOTIFYCMD \/sbin\/upssched/g' /etc/nut/upsmon.conf
    $ echo '
    MONITOR MGE-Ellipse750@localhost 1 kevin badpassword master
    NOTIFYFLAG ONBATT SYSLOG+WALL+EXEC
    NOTIFYFLAG ONLINE SYSLOG+WALL+EXEC
    ' >> /etc/nut/upsmon.conf
    $ sed -i 's/CMDSCRIPT \/upssched-cmd/CMDSCRIPT \/etc\/nut\/upssched-cmd/g' /etc/nut/upssched.conf
    $ sed -i 's/# PIPEFN \/var\/run\/nut\/upssched\/upssched.pipe/PIPEFN \/var\/run\/nut\/upssched.pipe/g' /etc/nut/upssched.conf
    $ sed -i 's/# LOCKFN \/var\/run\/nut\/upssched\/upssched.lock/LOCKFN \/var\/run\/nut\/upssched.lock/g' /etc/nut/upssched.conf
    $ echo '
    AT ONBATT * START-TIMER onbatt 30
    AT ONLINE * CANCEL-TIMER onbatt
    ' >> /etc/nut/upssched.conf
    $ echo '
    #!/bin/sh
    exit 0
    ' > /etc/nut/upssched-cmd
    $ /etc/init.d/nut restart

As you can see you have lots of stuff to configure before Nut can do what it was designed for. But after all of these commands, you should have a working UPS.

You can now test that your system works by using the command below, which list statistics of a given UPS:

    :::bash
    $ upsc MGE-Ellipse750@localhost

But in some rare cases, your UPS will not be recognized and you'll have like me the following messages in your `/var/log/syslog`:

    :::text
    May  5 16:12:36 paris-server upsmon[10773]: Poll UPS [MGE-Ellipse750@127.0.0.1] failed - Driver not connected

In this case, you should run Nut's driver in debug mode:

    :::bash
    $ /lib/nut/usbhid-ups -DDD -a MGE-Ellipse750
    Network UPS Tools - Generic HID driver 0.34 (2.4.3)

       0.190252     Can't claim USB device [0463:ffff]: could not detach kernel driver from interface 0: Operation not permitted

As you can see in messages above, Nut can't see my UPS. By chance, forcing nut to use the `root` user let it see my UPS:

    :::bash
    $ /lib/nut/usbhid-ups -DDD -u root -a MGE-Ellipse750

    (...)

So the issue is now clear and is related to permissions. I was able to fix this issue by changing the permissions on the USB device corresponding to my UPS:

    :::bash
    $ chmod 0666 /dev/bus/usb/005/003

Another working way to fix this is to change the group of the device to `nut`:

    :::bash
    $ chown :nut /dev/bus/usb/005/003

BTW, to get the bus number (`005` here) and device number (`003` in my case) of your UPS, run `lsudb`:

    :::bash
    $ lsusb
    Bus 005 Device 003: ID 0463:ffff MGE UPS Systems UPS
    Bus 005 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
    Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
    Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
    Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
    Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

Of course this fix is absolutely temporary, as you'll need to perform the change above after every reboot. This is far from practical. In fact, as describe in this [Fedora 10 bug report](http://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=488368), but also in [some](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=529664) [other](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=334105) Debian [bug report](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=325878), this issue is directly tied to conflicting Udev rules.

Based on clues from these bug reports you can fix Udev using different strategies. As I can't decide which one is the cleanest, I just did something that is quite brutal, but works. It consist of replacing in `/lib/udev/rules.d/91-permissions.rules` the line setting rights for USBfs-like devices:

    :::diff

     SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device", \
    -                               MODE="0664"
    +                               MODE="0666"

Now all you have to do is to unplug the power cord and wait until your machine gracefully shut down as soon as batteries are low ! :)
