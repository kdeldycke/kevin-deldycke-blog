During the first (cold) hours of 2010, I've [done some light painting](https://maomium.com/light-painting-part-one/) compositions with a friend. Discovering he was into this stuff and having my [Canon 7D DSLR](https://amzn.com/B002NEGTTW/?tag=kevideld-20) at hand, we decided to improvise a little session of long exposure shots. Here is a sample of photos we've took:
