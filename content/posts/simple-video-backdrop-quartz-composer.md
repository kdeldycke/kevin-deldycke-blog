While playing with Quartz Composer, the only composition I made with a clear intention of using it was this one:

As you can see, it's just [my band](http://coolcavemen.com)'s logo, subtly glowing (or breathing, as you wish). It's a simple but effective animated stage backdrop. I haven't used it in any of our concert, but next time a video projector is present on stage, I will ! :)

As usual, here is the [source composition](http://kevin.deldycke.com/static/documents/glowing-cool-cavemen.qtz), and a preview of the patch:
