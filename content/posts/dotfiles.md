title: dotfiles for OSX and Kubuntu
tags: GitHub, Python, vim, Apple, Mac OS X, Kubuntu, Solarized

It's finally time to announce the availability of [all my dotfiles on
GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/dotfiles). I've started the project 2 months ago and now
things are stable enough to publish this blog post.

It's an hybrid repository which support both OSX and Kubuntu. This collection of configuration
files are mainly aimed at Python developers working in vim. All color schemes are based on
[Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) and most, if not all, command lines produces
colored output.
