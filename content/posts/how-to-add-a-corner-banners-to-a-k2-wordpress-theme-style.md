In this post I will give you all the technical details to create a corner banner
for the wordpress K2 theme. This solution is uninstrusive as it can be bundled
with a K2 style without modifying the K2 core theme.

We will use the new
[hooks](http://code.google.com/p/kaytwo/wiki/K2CSSandCustomCSS#PHP) from the
brand new
[K2 1.0RC6](https://web.archive.org/web/20140627211340/http://getk2.com/2008/04/k2-release-candidate-6-released/). So
first, we have to create a `functions.php` file in our style directory (example:
`/wp-content/themes/k2/styles/my-style`). Then add the following PHP code in it:

    :::html+php
    <?php

    // Add HTML code required by our corner banner
    function add_corner_banner() {
      ?>
      <a
        id="cornerbanner"
        href="http://coolcavemen.com/news/new-website-beta-released/"
        title="New website released as beta version !">
      </a>
      <?php
    }

    // Call add_corner_banner() method on each template_body_top hook
    add_action('template_body_top', 'add_corner_banner');

    ?>

This code tell K2 to replace the `template_body_top` hook define in all K2
pages, by the result of the `add_corner_banner()` PHP function. This function is
coded to return the HTML code we need for the corner banner.

Then we need to add the following CSS code to our style
(`/wp-content/themes/k2/styles/my-style/my-style.css`):

    :::css
    #cornerbanner {
      background: url(
        "/wp-content/themes/k2/styles/my-style/corner-banner.png") no-repeat;
      display: block;
      height: 205px;
      width: 205px;
      position: absolute;
      top: 0;
      right: 0;
      z-index: 999;
      text-decoration: none;
    }

This CSS code refer to the
[`corner-banner.png`](/uploads/2008/corner-banner.png) which is a 205x205 px PNG
image with an alpha channel to simulate shadows and fine transparency. Here is
the [Gimp `.xcf` source file](/uploads/2008/corner-banner.xcf) I used to
generate it.

This CSS code is designed for a top right banner. If you need a top left banner,
replace:

    :::css
      right: 0;

by

    :::css
      left: 0;

This also work for horizontal positioning:

    :::css
      top: 0;

can be replaced by

    :::css
      bottom: 0;

That's all ! My solution is not supposed to work (and was not tested) with
Internet Explorer as the latter is known to have
[terrible PNG transparency support](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics#Web_browser_support_for_PNG).
You can still apply fixes on my code using
[iepngfix](http://www.twinhelix.com/css/iepngfix/),
[jquery](http://jquery.andreaseberhard.de/pngFix/) or
[PNG8 images](http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2007/09/18/png8-the-clear-winner/).

I've provided you with all the technical details to create a corner banner and
add it to your K2 style seamlessly. It's now up to you to adapt it to your
needs. Be Creative ! Oh, and by the way, when you'll change the banner PNG file,
do not forget to update the CSS code with your image width and height.

**Update**: [my friend QPX](http://wqpx.wordpress.com) sent me an alternative
banner made with photoshop: here is the
[ready-to-use PNG file](/uploads/2008/corner-banner-qpx.png) and the
[Photoshop source file](/uploads/2008/corner-banner-qpx.psd).
