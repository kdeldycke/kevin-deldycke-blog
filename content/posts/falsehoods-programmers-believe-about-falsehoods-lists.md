Inspired by a [Hacker News
comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13260149), and to perfectly
complement the curated list of [*Awesome Falsehoods Programmers Believe
in*](https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-falsehood) I maintain on the side,
here is a glorious list of meta falsehoods:

## Falsehoods

1. Falsehoods are true.
2. Falsehoods are false.

13. There exists a falsehoods list that is entirely true.
14. Falsehood lists covers one subject.

 * Falsehoods are addressed by standards.

## Audience

 * Only widely believed falsehoods are listed.
 * Falsehood lists are for programmers.
 * Falsehood lists are written by programmers.
 * Falsehood lists are written by people with expertise in the matter.
 * Reading falsehoods lists make you a better programmer.
 * Reading falsehoods lists make you an expert.
 * Writing falsehoods lists make you a better programmer.
 * Writing falsehoods lists make you an expert.
 * Writer of falsehood lists are [immune to their edicted
falsehoods](https://twitter.com/benjiweber/status/785422755843956736).
 * Compiling falsehoods lists make you a better programmer.
 * There are programmers who do not believe in any falsehood.
 * Only programmers are subjected to falsehoods.
 * Programmers can change their beliefs.
 * Discussing falsehoods is never a waste of time.

## Meta

 * This list of falsehoods doesn't apply to itself.
