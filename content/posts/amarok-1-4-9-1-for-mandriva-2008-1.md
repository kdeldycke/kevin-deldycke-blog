[Amarok 1.4.9.1 was released 6 weeks ago](http://amarok.kde.org/en/fastforward_149) and was [backported to Mandriva 2008.1](ftp://ftp.proxad.net/pub/Distributions_Linux/MandrivaLinux/official/2008.1/SRPMS/main/backports) some times after. Usually I wait the "official" backport to rebuild the RPM with some extra features and add it to [my personnal repository](http://github.com/kdeldycke/mandriva-specs).

But this time it's different: for Mandriva 2008.1, all the features I added to my builds (especially the full SQLite, MySQL and Postgresql database support) are now included in the "officialy" backported RPM. So starting from Mandriva 2008.1, you don't need my Amarok backports. All you need is the love from the official backport repository (FTP URL given above). I'm happy as this mean more free time for me and less things to maintain ! ;)
