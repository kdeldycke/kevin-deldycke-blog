I ordered a [23andMe](http://23andme.com) v1 kit (_[Time's invention of the year 2008](http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1852747_1854493,00.html)_) in early march. The [version 2 of the "personal genetic kit"](http://23andme.com/howitworks/) was [released some months ago](http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/09/23andme-cuts-it.html).

As a late v1 customer, they offered me a free v2 upgrade. Even if I had to pay the shipping ($70 as european), that's really fair as it accounts for $399. They also gave me two $100 coupons. So if you do the maths, they offered me the difference between the price I paid for the v1 ($999) and the actual value of the v2 kit ($399). That's an honest commercial act ! :)

Alas, the coupons **expires December 31 2008**, and I don't plan to take advantages of the discount. So I'll give them away to the firsts of you who send me a mail or post a comment.
