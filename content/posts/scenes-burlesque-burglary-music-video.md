After my post announcing the [release of the official music video](http://kevin.deldycke.com/2012/01/burlesque-burglary-music-video-released/) for Cool Cavemen, I published an article which compile all my [production notes](http://kevin.deldycke.com/2012/06/burlesque-burglary-music-video-production-notes/).

Today I'm happy to write the last post about the Burlesque Burglary video project, which is all about fun: let me present you the much awaited "Behind The Scenes" video.

As usual with Cool Cavemen, and to our delight, it boils down to a mountain of crazy ideas and a jumble of absurd conversations. Judge for yourself:

I created this video using leftovers from the recording session. Which means the video material was all produced by a [Canon EOS 7D](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NEGTTW/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=kevideld-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399381&creativeASIN=B002NEGTTW) and a [Canon EF-S 15-85 mm f/3,5-5,6 IS USM](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NEGTTM/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=kevideld-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=B002NEGTTM) lens, at 1080p, 25 fps and a 1/50s shutter speed. 

 



If you're a long-time reader of that blog, it's not a surprise for you that I edited it with [Kdenlive](http://kdenlive.org). Here is my final timeline, for reference and inspiration:

The thing I'm particularly proud of in this BTS, is the puppets at the end, on the credit screen. The effect is simple but extremely effective. Each puppet is just composed of two steps (open & close mouth):

Each state is activated according the audio track, and they come in and out of the frame thanks to a simple slide transition. Here is a zoom on that part of the Kdenlive timeline:
