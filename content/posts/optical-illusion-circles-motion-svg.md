category: English
tags: Creative Commons, inkscape, optical illusion, svg, visuals

Here is an optical illusion I generated with [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org). I created this file some years ago and found it recently while cleaning my archives.

Using a contrast trick it appears that [circles are in motions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_illusion). Click on the image below to get a full-size preview:
