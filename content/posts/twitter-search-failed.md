Had an issue with [ÜberCart](http://www.ubercart.org/) tonight.

Was sure I already solved it.

Knew I explained the solution on Twitter.

Tried to [search for it](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=ubercart+from%3Akdeldycke):

and failed !

And all I was looking for was [this little tweet](http://twitter.com/kdeldycke/status/1508913388).

Is [Twitter's search](http://search.twitter.com) supposed to work ? :(
