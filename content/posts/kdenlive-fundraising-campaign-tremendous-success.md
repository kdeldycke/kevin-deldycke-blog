Two months ago [I made a donation to Kdenlive](http://kevin.deldycke.com/2012/03/200-dollars-kdenlive-contribution/) fundraising campaign and I just found out that I'm the biggest contributor. And like other $100+ contributors, I was offered a place to write a [testimonial](http://kdenlive.org/fundraising-campaign-2012):

If I won some bragging rights, this is minor news compared to how much the community participated: the initial goal was set to $4000 but collected funds ended up at $7419. Almost twice as much as expected ! That's were the good news is: there is no doubt Kdenlive is well supported by a dedicated and generous community.

It makes me happy as I feel I bet on the right horse when choosing Kdenlive to edit my humble videos. Long live to Kdenlive ! :)
