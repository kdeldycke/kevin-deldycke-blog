I updated the baghira rpm with the 24/02/2006 CVS version. This version correct a very annoying bug I had with the previous RPM. Now Kpdf doesn't freeze anymore.

I also added newer version of qemu and kqemu v0.7.2 I found on [P.Terjan repository](http://fasmz.org/~pterjan/rpm/) and Amarok 1.4beta2 from the [gkmweb.com repository](http://www.gkmweb.com/amarok/2006.0/1.4-beta/).
