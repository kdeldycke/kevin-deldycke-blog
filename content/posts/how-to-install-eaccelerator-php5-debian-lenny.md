[eAccelerator](http://eaccelerator.net) is an _open-source PHP accelerator,
optimizer, and dynamic content cache_ (to quote the official website of the
project). It can effectively speed-up PHP processing on a server by caching
bytecode.

As Wikipedia tells you,
[several tools of this kind exists](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_PHP_accelerators).
Why choosing eAccelerator in particular ? I really have no clue... I've never
used any of these tools, so I had to start somewhere. That's as simple as that!

Now, I have a Debian server as a target system. Unfortunately, eAccelerator is
not bundled in Lenny. Browsing the web, I found some personal repositories of
people kindly sharing their deb packages, like
[Andrew McMillan](http://andrew.mcmillan.net.nz/node/70) and
[schnuckelig.eu](http://www.schnuckelig.eu/blog/debian-lenny-eaccelerator-packages-amd64-20090527).
The former provides a version of eAccelerator for the `i386`, the latter for the
`amd64` architecture. In this how-to, I've combined the 2 repositories to give
both 32 bits and 64 bits users a chance to use eAccelerator on Lenny.

Let's start the installation ! First, add the following lines to your
`/etc/apt/sources.list` file:

    :::sourceslist
    deb http://debian.mcmillan.net.nz/debian lenny awm
    deb-src http://debian.mcmillan.net.nz/debian lenny awm
    deb http://debian.schnuckelig.eu/ lenny main contrib non-free

To kill annoying warning messages, register the cryptographic fingerprint of
each repository:

    :::bash
    $ gpg --keyserver keyring.debian.org --recv-keys 0x8f068012;
    $ gpg --export --armor 0x8f068012 | apt-key add -
    $ wget -O - http://debian.schnuckelig.eu/repository-key.gpg | apt-key add -

Then, update your package database:

    :::bash
    $ aptitude update

And finally, you can install eAccelerator for PHP5 without any pain:

    :::bash
    $ apt-get install php5-eaccelerator

Happy [fine-tunning](http://eaccelerator.net/wiki/Settings) !
