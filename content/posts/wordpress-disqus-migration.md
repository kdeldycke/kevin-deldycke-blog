I've just finished migrating all the comments of this blog from WordPress to
[Disqus](https://disqus.com). Why using an external comment platform? It's just
that I plan to ditch WordPress entirely, and switch to a static site generator
in the near future. Here are some details on my migration to Disqus.

Disqus has everything you need to easily import WordPress comments. But first,
I had to massage some data.

Articles of this blog features a lots of code. Comments are no exception and
embed snippets too. Code blocks are rendered by the [SyntaxHighlighter Evolved
WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/syntaxhighlighter/). This
extension use square brackets to enclose code. [Disqus uses standard HTML
tags](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/665057).

Let's update this notation directly in WordPress database:

    ```shell-session
    $ mysqldump --opt kevblog wp_comments > ./comments.sql
    $ perl -pe 's/\[code lang=(.*?)\]/<pre><code class=\1>/g' ./comments.sql > comments-fixed.sql
    $ sed -i 's/\[\/code\]/<\/code><\/pre>/g' ./comments-fixed.sql
    $ mysql kevblog < ./comments-fixed.sql
    ```

[Disqus doesn't support HTML
lists](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466253-what-html-tags-are-allowed-within-comments).
So I manually updated WordPress comments to remove occurrences of `<ul>` and
`<ol>`, and replace `<li>` by an UTF-8 `•`
[bullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_(typography)).

Another issue: if [Disqus support images in
comment](https://blog.disqus.com/post/3764930816/fun-with-images), in imported
comments they are left as HTML tags and therefore not rendered by Disqus. I was
the only one on my blog posting images in comments. So I simply moved them to
the corresponding parent article.

I then had to fix the comment threading. In the first versions of WordPress,
sub-commenting was not supported. I addressed this issue by recomposing
threading with a series of MySQL queries:

    ```mysql
    UPDATE `wp_comments` SET `comment_parent` = 234   WHERE `comment_ID` = 342;
    UPDATE `wp_comments` SET `comment_parent` = 4987  WHERE `comment_ID` = 5667;
    UPDATE `wp_comments` SET `comment_parent` = 10915 WHERE `comment_ID` = 10916;
    (...)
    ```

After all these updates, my comments where ready to be [exported to
Disqus](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466255-exporting-comments-from-wordpress-to-disqus).

If most of my comments were successfully imported, some were left-out. The
importer was not able to find their parents:

![Disqus comment import: unable to find parent
post](/uploads/2013/disqus-import-error.png)

But the reported error was not true: parent's IDs were good and referenced an
existing comment. Besides, comments Disqus was not able to import were
correctly placed in their thread on my original WordPress blog.

For a moment I trough Disqus import code was [subject to a race
condition](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/disqus-dev/LqCcFy67RJY/discussion).
But there was no `<wp:comment_parent />` tags in my XML file.

I also checked that no comment were moderated:

    ```shell-session
    $ grep -c "<wp:comment_approved>0</wp:comment_approved>" ./kevindeldycke.wordpress.2013-01-15-fixed.xml
    0
    $ grep -c "<wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved>" ./kevindeldycke.wordpress.2013-01-15-fixed.xml
    892
    ```

I decided to check the comments carefully. Following the chain of comment's
parents, I found the root cause. All unimported comments were descendants of an
anonymous commenter. These shared the following empty properties:

    ```xml
    <wp:comment_author><![CDATA[]]></wp:comment_author>
    <wp:comment_author_email></wp:comment_author_email>
    ```

I then decided to forced anonymous comments to bear a generic author's name:

    ```shell-session
    $ perl -0p -e 's/(<wp:comment_author><!\[CDATA\[)(\]\]><\/wp:comment_author>\s*<wp:comment_author_email><\/wp:comment_author_email>)/\1Anonymous\2/sg' ./kevindeldycke.wordpress.2013-01-15-fixed.xml > test.xml
    ```

Resulting in the following changes:

    ```diff

I then sent the fixed WordPress XML export to Disqus as-is, which imported my
24 missing comments:
