One of my [best friend was just married](http://www.melaniethomas2012.com) this year, and to participate to this huge event, I helped him create a video for its wedding entrance. It's a video postcard of Paris with close friends and family:

I shot the video in a week-end (plus an extra afternoon), at 24 fps in 1080p, with the following equipment:

  * [Canon EOS 7D](http://amzn.com/B002NEGTTW/?tag=kevideld-20)



  * [Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS II USM](http://amzn.com/B0033PRWSW/?tag=kevideld-20)



  * [Sigma 30mm f/1.4 EX DC HSM](http://amzn.com/B0007U0GZM/?tag=kevideld-20)



  * [Tokina 11-16mm f/2.8](http://amzn.com/B0014Z3XMC/?tag=kevideld-20)



  * [Tamron SP AF 17-50mm f/2.8 XR Di-II VC LD IF lens](http://amzn.com/B002LVUIXA/?tag=kevideld-20)



  * [HDV-Z96 LED light](http://amzn.com/B003UCGDSS/?tag=kevideld-20)



  * [Manfrotto 055XPROB Pro Tripod Legs](http://amzn.com/B000UMX7FI/?tag=kevideld-20)



  * [Manfrotto 701HDV Pro Fluid Video Mini Head](http://amzn.com/B001AT314M/?tag=kevideld-20)



  * a basic Canon Monopod 100

  * And finally, my brand new [Glidecam HD-2000](http://amzn.com/B0020LB0MO/?tag=kevideld-20)



It was the first time I used my Glidecam, and the [Tokina 11-16mm](http://amzn.com/B0014Z3XMC/?tag=kevideld-20)

 is a good match for this hand-held stabilizer.

There's 4 long takes in the video. The third was the most challenging, as I had to climb the stairs while following the action.

You'll notice that some movements are too fast and some others are wobbly. Probably because my gear was not well balanced, mainly because I didn't had enough practice at the time. But it doesn't hurt the final result and I'm impressed by what some simple SteadyCam shots bring to the project. My Glidecam was a wise investment ! :)

If I shot the whole video, the groom and his brother did the audio mix and video edit. Kudos to them ! :)
