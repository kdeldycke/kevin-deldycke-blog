Version 0.3 of [Plumage](https://github.com/kdeldycke/plumage), my theme for [Pelican](https://getpelican.com) has been released. It is also available in the official [Pelican's themes repository](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes).

It's the first version to include contributions from other developers. Thanks to [Cedric Bosdonnat](https://github.com/cbosdo) & [Jeff Smith](https://github.com/jeffreyksmithjr)! :)

Here is the changelog:

  * Add auto-zoom of images based on Magnific Popup.
  * Let the content take the available width if there is no right or left sidebars.
  * Add an dynamic feed link in footer.
  * Do not wrap code in code blocks.
  * Fix code highlight for older Pelican versions.
  * Escape and strip tags in all title attributes.
  * Style ampersands for those using typogrify.
