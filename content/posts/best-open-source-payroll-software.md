title: I wrote the best Open-Source Payroll Software of the world!

... at least [according Smile](https://www.smile.eu), a French consulting
company.

They studied [Open-Source
ERPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Free_ERP_software) in their latest white paper. It is [available for download
here](https://www.scribd.com/document/180544336/LB-Smile-ERP-pdf). And here is what they said about ERP5 at page 77:

> ERP5 va même jusqu'à gérer les paies alors qu'aucun autre ERP libre n'est
allé aussi loin

Which roughly translates to:

> ERP5 even manage payroll, while any other free software ERP has gone as far

Hey wait. I wrote this module!

And here is their final evaluation (0 is the lowest, 5 the highest note) of all
payroll systems for each ERP (from page 88):

ERP | Evaluation
--- | ---
[TinyERP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odoo#Company_history) | ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5)
[OpenBravo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openbravo) | ☆☆☆☆☆ (0/5)
[Neogia](https://sourceforge.net/projects/neogia/) | ☆☆☆☆☆ (0/5)
[ERP5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERP5) | ★★★★☆ (4/5)
[Adempiere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adempiere) | ☆☆☆☆☆ (0/5)
[Compiere GPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiere) | ☆☆☆☆☆ (0/5)

As you can see I not only got the first place: I wiped out the competition.

Sorry for the shameless self-promotion, but I was so happy to get this
distinction after so many pain trying to transform laws into code that I
couldn't resist... :)

The payroll modules were one of my biggest [contribution as a core developer on
ERP5](https://www.openhub.net/p/erp5/contributors/18391049963153). It was
capable of [producing the
paysheets](https://web.archive.org/web/20110128111823/https://www.erp5.org/workspaces/project/erp5_payroll/erp5_pay_sheet_for_n/view)
of all Nexedi's employees. Here is an example:

These modules were so extensive that I wrote a detailed tutorial based on them.
As it was the only comprehensive documentation available on ERP5, my work
virtually became the [ERP5's bible for
developers](https://web.archive.org/web/20050924101245/https://www.erp5.org/sections/documentation/articles/erp5_developer_tutor3829/downloadFile/file/Tutorial-Kevin-en.pdf?nocache=1114902907.39)
for a while.

The [English translation is available for
download](https://web.archive.org/web/20050924101245/https://www.erp5.org/sections/documentation/articles/erp5_developer_tutor3829/downloadFile/file/Tutorial-Kevin-en.pdf?nocache=1114902907.39). The [original French version](https://web.archive.org/web/20091115172519/http://cps.erp5.org/sections/documentation/articles/erp5_developer_tutor/view), titled *Développez votre propre ERP grâce
aux Business Templates ERP5* has disappeared from the web.

This document was enough of a reference to be cited in a couple of academic papers from
2006 to 2009:

* [A comparison of Open Source ERP
Systems](https://www.big.tuwien.ac.at/app/uploads/2016/10/Herzog_paper.pdf#page=77)

* [A Research on Corporate ERP Systems used for Supermarket Supply Chain

COMPIERE](https://web.archive.org/web/20101010002846/https://wiki.itin.fr/index.php/Comparatif_ERP5_/_COMPIERE_MT09_FR)

The irony is that after leaving the open-source ERP world in 2007, I was
recruited by Smile in 2011, the very same company which produced the original
white paper. My job? Working full on [OpenERP]({tag}openerp), the direct
competitor of ERP5.
