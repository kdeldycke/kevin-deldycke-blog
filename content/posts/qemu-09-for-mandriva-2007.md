tags: kqemu, Linux, Mandriva, Qemu, Repository, RPM, urpmi

I've just backported [qemu](http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/) 0.9 to Mandriva 2007. This release include the [kqemu 1.3.0pre11 kernel module, which was released under the GPL some weeks ago](http://lwn.net/Articles/220807/).

As usual, this package is [available in my RPM repository.]((http://github.com/kdeldycke/mandriva-specs)
