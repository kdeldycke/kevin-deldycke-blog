![QLC 2.6.1 on Mandriva 2008.1](/static/uploads/2008/05/qlc-261-on-mandriva-20081.png)

I've just backported QLC 2.6.1 from Fedora Core to Mandriva 2008.1. [Q Light Controller](http://qlc.sourceforge.net) is a software designed to pilot lights (both moving and static ones) on stages via the [DMX communication protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMX512-A). This is my first step to bring together two of my main recent interests: [stage lighting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_lighting) and linux.

These RPMs are currently [only available for the x86_64 version of Mandriva](http://kevin.deldycke.com/static/repository/mandriva/2008.1/x86_64) but includes the [Open DMX USB drivers](http://www.erwinrol.com/index.php?opensource/dmxusb.php) and [Lighting Architecture for Linux (LLA)](http://www.nomis52.net/?section=projects&sect2=lla&page=llaintro) packages. All the sources of these packages came from the [repository I found](http://rpms.netmindz.net/FC6/) in the ["LLA, OpenDMX USB and Q Light Controller Tutorial" tutorial](http://opendmx.net/index.php/LLA,_OpenDMX_USB_and_Q_Light_Controller_Tutorial).

I haven't played with QLC yet: I've just started it and as you can see on the screenshot it seems to work. Happy testing ! ;)
