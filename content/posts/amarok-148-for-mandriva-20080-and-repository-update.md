I've just rebuild [Amarok 1.4.8](http://amarok.kde.org/fastforward_148) for
Mandriva 2008.0 with MySQL and PostgreSQL support.

This was also an opportunity for me to rebuild old packages
([Interreta Televidilo](http://televidilo.bouil.org),
 [Rugg](http://rugg.sourceforge.net) and
 [python-icalendar](http://codespeak.net/icalendar)) for Mandriva 2008.0. For
now there is no x86_64 version of the packages (including Amarok). I plan to do
it later.

Update: Amarok was recompiled to include latest
[libgpod](http://www.gtkpod.org/libgpod.html) version (0.6.0).
