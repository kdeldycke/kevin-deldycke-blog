I just released version 0.7 of my [Plumage
theme](https://github.com/kdeldycke/plumage) for Pelican.

This one come with a big new feature thanks to [Renato
Cunha](https://github.com/trovao), who made a huge contribution by integrating
[Tipue Search](https://www.tipue.com/search/), providing fully static
search over all content of a Pelican site.

Some tiny adjustments were also made on analytics tracking code with
additional support of newer Google Analytics Universal thanks to [Florian
Wilhelm](https://github.com/FlorianWilhelm).
