## Native commands

  * Produce a patch file of changes committed in revision 1377:

        :::shell-session
        $ svn diff -r 1376:1377 > diff.patch

  * Merge revision `3403` of the trunk into the "1.0" branch:

        :::shell-session
        $ cd branches/1.0
        $ svn merge -c3403 https://svn.example.com/my_project/trunk
        $ svn commit -m "Merge r3403 into the 1.0 branch."

  * Revert current local folder to revision 666:

        :::shell-session
        $ svn merge -rHEAD:666 ./

  * Create an empty repository:

        :::shell-session
        $ svnadmin create ./my-repo

  * Dump a repository (a sure way to migrate a subversion repository from one version to another):

        :::shell-session
        $ svnadmin dump ./my-repo > ./my-repo.dmp

  * Migrate a remote Subversion repository without creating an intermediate dump file:

        :::shell-session
        $ ssh -C user@myserver.com "svnadmin dump /home/user/my-repo" | svnadmin load /home/user2/my-new-repo

  * Launch a standalone Subversion server listening on port 3690 and serving all repositories located in `./repos/`:

        :::shell-session
        $ svnserve --daemon --listen-port 3690 --root ./repos/

## Local working copy hacking

  * Recursive and case insensitive content search on non-binary files from the current folder, while ignoring `.svn` folders and their content:

        :::shell-session
        $ find ./ -type f -not -regex ".*\/.svn\/.*" -exec grep -Iil "string to search" {} \;

  * Same thing as above but with an alternative approach (that don't work with large folder content):

        :::shell-session
        $ grep -Ii "string to search" $(find . | grep -v .svn)

  Other alternative: use [ack](https://petdance.com/ack/).

  * Use `sed` to replace text in all files except in subversion metadatas:

        :::shell-session
        $ find ./ -type f -not -regex ".*\/.svn\/.*" -print -exec sed -i 's/str1/str2/g' "{}" \;

  * Use `svn delete` to remove all files containing a tilde in their name without touching local subversion metadatas:

        :::shell-session
        $ find -type f -not -regex ".*\/.svn\/.*" -name "*Ëœ*" -print -exec svn delete "{}" \;

  * In a repository structure containing sub-projects (thinks of [Plone's collective repository](https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/) as an example), get the list of all folders in all trunks, while ignoring subversion metadata folders:

        :::shell-session
        $ find ./ -type d -regex ".*\/trunk\/?.*" -not -regex ".*\/.svn\/?.*" -print

  * Similarly to the command above, replace all occurrences of the string `@coolcavemen.fr` by `@coolcavemen.com` in all `trunk` subfolders while ignoring `.svn` content:

        :::shell-session
        $ find ./ -type f -regex ".*\/trunk\/.*" -not -regex ".*\/.svn\/.*" -print -exec sed -i 's/@coolcavemen\.fr/@coolcavemen\.com/g' "{}" \;

  * Set a svn property to ignore all `.mo` files during commit in every folder of our local working copy containing `.po` files:

        :::shell-session
        $ find ./ -type f -name "*.po" -regex ".*\/trunk\/.*" -not -regex ".*\/.svn\/.*" -printf "%h\n" | uniq | xargs svn propset "svn:ignore" "*.mo"
