I wanted to try
[mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_miners#Bitcoin_mining) on my
Kubuntu 13.04. Not to get rich, but simply to verify that the production of
[crypto-currencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) really was
decentralized, and also to learn how-to mine.

I first tried mining [Bitcoin](http://bitcoin.org) with
[BFGMiner](http://bfgminer.org). I choose the later over
[cgminer](https://github.com/ckolivas/cgminer) because that's the only one I
found to be readily [available from an Ubuntu
PPA](https://launchpad.net/~unit3/+archive/bfgminer):

    :::bash
    $ sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list <<-EOF
        deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/unit3/bfgminer/ubuntu quantal main
        deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/unit3/bfgminer/ubuntu quantal main
      EOF
    $ sudo aptitude install bfgminer

Unfortunately the version was not up to date, and was not compiled for mining
[scrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt)-based coins like
[Litecoin](https://litecoin.org). Here is how I built BFGMiner with this
support.

Install the dependencies:

    :::bash
    $ sudo aptitude install build-essential autoconf libtool libjansson-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libncurses5-dev libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev yasm uthash-dev

Get a copy of the latest version and prepare the environment:

    :::bash
    $ cd ~
    $ git clone https://github.com/luke-jr/bfgminer.git
    $ cd bfgminer/
    $ ./autogen.sh

Then I built it while enabling scrypt and CPU optimizations:

    :::bash
    $ ./configure --enable-cpumining --enable-scrypt
    $ make

Then create a config file in `~/.bfgminer/bfgminer.conf`:

    :::json
    {
    "pools" : [
      {
        "url" : "stratum+tcp://coinotron.com:3334",
        "user" : "foo.ltc",
        "pass" : "xxxxxxxxxx",
        "pool-priority" : "0"
      },
      {
        "url" : "http://p2pool.org:9327",
        "user" : "LTxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "pass" : "password",
        "pool-priority" : "1"
      }
    ]
    ,
    "algo" : "scrypt",
    "api-port" : "4028",
    "expiry" : "120",
    "expiry-lp" : "3600",
    "gpu-dyninterval" : "7",
    "log" : "5",
    "no-pool-disable" : true,
    "no-show-processors" : true,
    "no-show-procs" : true,
    "queue" : "1",
    "scan-time" : "60",
    "scrypt" : true,
    "skip-security-checks" : "0",
    "submit-stale" : true,
    "temp-hysteresis" : "3",
    "shares" : "0",
    "kernel-path" : "/usr/local/bin"
    }

And your ready to launch the miner:

    :::bash
    $ ~/bfgminer/bfgminer
