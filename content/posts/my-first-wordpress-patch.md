Last week I've submitted a patch to the Wordpress open souce project. This [tiny patch](http://trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/3753/wp-default-theme-show-comments-on-pages.diff) fix a little bug on Kubrick default theme which didn't display the list of comments associated with a page. I've [spotted that bug some months ago](http://kevin.deldycke.com/2006/11/wordpress-to-e107-v05-static-pages-import-added/) when working on my e107 to Wordpress import script. As you can see in the [trac ticket](http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3753), my patch was committed in the trunk of the project, and you can expect to see it in the next 2.2 version release.
