[In 2010 I created `maildir-deduplicate.py`](https://kevin.deldycke.com/2010/08/maildir-deduplication-script-python/),
a one-of script to detect and remove duplicate copies of emails.

Since then, [Adam](https://blog.adamspiers.org) added loads of features and
refinements to it, promoting himself to the de-facto maintainer. 3 months ago he
privately asked me if I could split this script out of its messy home. Which
makes sense.

This post is just a message to all `maildir-deduplicate.py` users. The script is
no longer available in my generic repository. It now has
[its own dedicated repository on GitHub](https://github.com/kdeldycke/maildir-deduplicate),
for which Adam has full administration rights.
