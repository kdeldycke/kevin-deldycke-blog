I [just donated $200](https://twitter.com/#!/kdeldycke/status/182018605259567104) to the [Kdenlive](http://kdenlive.org) project, as they have [just started](http://kdenlive.org/users/ttill/kdenlive-fundraising-campaign) a [fundraising campaign](http://www.indiegogo.com/kdenlive-re) to refactor its core and make it future-proof:

The amount of collected funds is currently at $3,041 from the $4,000 required to pay a developer to work full-time for 2 months. With only $959 remaining and 41 days left, you have no reason to not contribute to the best open-source video editor out there.

I started to play with Kdenlive several years ago with version 0.3. I even [created some RPM packages](http://kevin.deldycke.com/2007/04/kdenlive-04-for-mandriva-20070/) back then. Kdenlive suffered from heavy instabilities in its early days.

But this was a long time ago and today it’s the most stable and practical video editing software available on Linux. It's the best open-source tool for amateur DSLR shooters, and is worth a try even if your primary desktop manager is not KDE.

Today this software is the one I spend most of my time in at home (just after a web browser and a command-line terminal). And I've never felt as productive as the last 2 years: I [edited about 2 hours of videos](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL003033C52FE5047D) in that period.

Kdenlive must continue to grow. And because I want to use it in my future projects, it makes sense to make a donation. So what are you waiting for contributing too ? :)
