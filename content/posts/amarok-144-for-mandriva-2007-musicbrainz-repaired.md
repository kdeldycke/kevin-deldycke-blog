I'm happy to announce you that the latest version of Amarok for Mandriva 2007
now feature a fully functionnal MusicBrainz ! Look at the
[screenshot](/uploads/2006/amarok-144-with-musicbrainz.png) for evidences.

This build, named amarok-1.4.4-3, is exactly the same as
[previous one](http://kevin.deldycke.com/2006/10/amarok-144-for-mandriva-2007/)
(i.e. with SQLite, MySQL and Postgresql support). Don't forget to update the
libtunepimp package from [my repository](http://github.com/kdeldycke/mandriva-specs)
and use the 5.0 version.
