Just earned my bragging rights last month, with my [Awesome List of Falsehoods
Programmers Believe in](https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-falsehood). Here's
my repository, at the top of the charts:

It was the direct effect of getting to the [front page of Hacker
News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13637102).

All that attention made me the [top developer on
GitHub](https://twitter.com/kdeldycke/status/831451728625168384) for a couple
of days:

Yes, my face, right above the heavy-weights of the industry.

I wanted to [be a hot
dancer](https://genius.com/Incubus-you-will-be-a-hot-dancer-lyrics). I ended up
a hot developer. Next step would be to code in leopard thongs I guess.
