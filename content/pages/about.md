My name is **Kevin Deldycke**, I'm a Senior Software Engineer living in Paris,
France.

---------

I'm working at [Scaleway](https://scaleway.com), a cloud platform delivering
on-demand bare-metal compute instances, and all the associated services.

I'm designing and implementing data-crunching pipelines to manage the
operationnal and business aspects of the infrastructure.

This involves working daily with [Python]({tag}python) (coding with it since
2003), [Pandas]({tag}pandas), Cassandra, Spark, [PostgreSQL]({tag}postgresql)
and the likes.

---------

Before joining [Scaleway](https://scaleway.com), I spent several years writing
and shipping business software in various industries such as banking, retail,
consulting, energy, transport and government agencies.

I graduated with a Master’s in Software and Industrial Engineering from
[*École Centrale de Lille*'s IG2I
department](http://www.ec-lille.fr/en/degree/ig2l-en.html).


## Achievements

- Designed and implemented the whole telemetry and [billing
pipeline](https://scaleway.com/faq/billing/) which Scaleway relies on to

payroll](http://kevin.deldycke.com/2008/06/best-open-source-payroll-software/)
software of the world.

## Resume

If my appalling attempts to impress with the babbling above did not worked, you
may be thrilled by the following soporific information on my professional
background:

Format | Language
---|---
PDF | [English](http://docs.google.com/a/deldycke.com/document/export?format=pdf&id=1XaJgwRAhxHDuBSD-JqE--8WKGx0uTasa6IOU4IFBeKg) ● [French](http://docs.google.com/a/deldycke.com/document/export?format=pdf&id=1JYITJ3JU9WYvQXWlpGqLO9LzhcfAxiqJSsV8WyVhyyY)
LinkedIn | [English](http://linkedin.com/in/kevindeldycke/en) ● [French](http://linkedin.com/in/kevindeldycke/fr)

Resumes, CVs and profiles above are heavy on details you may not be interested
in. If these documents are too verbose for you and contain superfluous
information, then that's absolutely intentional.

In fact, I designed those as a kind of extensive "professional
activities database". Not as resume _per se_. So feel free to pick there
data you need to fill in your talent database and please ignore the rest.


## About this site

This place is an evolving notebook where I deposit tiny pieces of knowledge
(*knowledgelets*?) I generate in my personal and professional activities.

Everything's in English as a way to practice, and to make my knowledge
available to the widest audience. It's not my mother tongue and you’ll surely
find mistakes. If you do, please be kind enough to comment on the blog (or
better, [send a
pull-request](https://github.com/kdeldycke/kevin-deldycke-blog/pulls)) so I can
quickly fix errors. I sometimes write [in French]({category}francais) to target
a French-speaking audience.

This blog was previously titled *coolkevmen*, which is the nickname under which
I appear in the creadits of [All Cool
Hits](http://coolcavemen.com/disc/all-cool-hits/) album by [Cool
Cavemen](http://coolcavemen.com). The latter being the band I [spent 10 years
of my life with]({tag}cool-cavemen), doing websites and [concert's
lighting]({tag}stage-lighting).
