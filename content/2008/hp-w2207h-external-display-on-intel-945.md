I recently had the oportunity to plug the [HP w2207h screen](https://amzn.com/B00139S3U6/?tag=kevideld-20) (see [review #1](https://www.anandtech.com/displays/showdoc.aspx?i=3054) and [review #2](https://www.prad.de/en/monitore/review/2007/review-hp-w2207.html)) as an external display to my [Samsung Q35 laptop]({filename}/2006/samsung-q35-xic-5500-tiny-review-of-a-strong-compact-laptop.md). The external display has a native resolution of 1680x1050 and the laptop's is 1280x800.

The laptop is powered by an [Intel 945 graphic chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_GMA#GMA_950):

```shell-session
$ lspci
00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Mobile 945GM/PM/GMS, 943/940GML and 945GT Express Memory Controller Hub (rev 03)
00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Mobile 945GM/GMS, 943/940GML Express Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 03)
00:02.1 Display controller: Intel Corporation Mobile 945GM/GMS/GME, 943/940GML Express Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 03)
(...)
```

[After some googling](https://slforums.typo3-factory.net/lofiversion/index.php/t63508.html) and tests, I've designed the perfect `xorg.conf` for this configuration:

What I've learned so far during these experiments:

- With DRI, [virtual screen can't be greater than 2048x2048](https://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Xorg_RandR_1.2#the_Virtual_screen) for Intel 945 (or less) chips. This explain why my screens are one above the other instead of side-by-side.

- [XRandR](https://www.x.org/wiki/Projects/XRandR) and its friend [KRandRTray](https://www.novell.com/coolsolutions/trench/16034.html) make screen positionning user-friendly...

- ...until you play with the `xrandr`'s "`--off`" option! After I manually called it, this parameter disabled all my screens, forever, and at each boot. I've randomly deleted xorg-related files, but I still didn't know how I solved this mess. If you have a better understanding of how `xrandr` store its configuration, please let me know!

- Dual screening is awesome! :D
