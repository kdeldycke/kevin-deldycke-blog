These past few days I was working on the [Cool Cavemen's photo gallery](https://coolcavemen.com/photos) to move it to a shiny new one, powered by [Zenphoto](https://zenphoto.org). In this post I will roughly describe how I've done it, code and commands included.

The old gallery was based on [autogallery](https://sourceforge.net/projects/e107autogallery), a [e107](https://e107.org) plugin. We assume here that both e107 and Zenphoto are well configured and installed at the root of you web hosting space (`/www` in this case).

The first step is to copy the autogallery album structure, with all its content, to Zenphoto:

```shell-session
$ cd /www
$ cp -ax ./e107_plugins/autogallery/Gallery/* ./zenphoto/albums/
```

Then we delete all previews, thumbnails and XML metadatas, to keep in Zenphoto original assets only:

```shell-session
$ find ./zenphoto/albums/ -iname "*.xml" | xargs rm -f
$ find ./zenphoto/albums/ -iname "pv_*" | xargs rm -f
$ find ./zenphoto/albums/ -iname "th_*" | xargs rm -f
```

By now, you should be able to play with your medias using Zenphoto's admin interface.

But if you're unlucky as I was, you will find a strange bug which break down drag'n'drop album sorting. The fix I found was to remove, in photo filenames, the numerical prefix (and the following dot) set by autogallery to define the sort order. This operation should be performed, _before_ the copy from autogallery to Zenphoto (= the first command in this post). By the way, if you know a one-liner to do this, please, please... share! :)

To migrate comments, I have no automatic solution. I choose to do this manually, editing the database by hand. In my case it was the quickest way as I only had a dozen of comments to migrate.

And last but not least, if you care about measuring the popularity of your photos, you should consider migrating the view counter associated with each of your media. Don't worry, this time I wrote a script to take care of it automagically. It will generate a bunch of SQL statements you'll have to execute on your Zenphoto MySQL database. Here is my "e107 autogallery to Zenphoto hit counter migration script" (nice name isn't it? ;) ) that do the job:

I think code and comments are self-explainatory. And do not forget to update constants at the top of the script to match your installation paths and database's tables prefix.

And finally, for your information, I tested all of this on following versions:

- e107 0.7.11
- autogallery 2.61
- Zenphoto 1.2
- Python 2.5.2
- Linux server
