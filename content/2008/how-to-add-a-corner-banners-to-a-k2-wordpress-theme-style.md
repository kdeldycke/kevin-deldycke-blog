In this post I will give you all the technical details to create a corner banner
for the wordpress K2 theme. This solution is uninstrusive as it can be bundled
with a K2 style without modifying the K2 core theme.

We will use the new
[hooks](https://code.google.com/p/kaytwo/wiki/K2CSSandCustomCSS#PHP) from the
brand new
[K2 1.0RC6](https://web.archive.org/web/20140627211340/https://getk2.com/2008/04/k2-release-candidate-6-released/). So
first, we have to create a `functions.php` file in our style directory (example:
`/wp-content/themes/k2/styles/my-style`). Then add the following PHP code in it:

```html+php
<?php

// Add HTML code required by our corner banner
function add_corner_banner() {
  ?>
  <a
    id="cornerbanner"
    href="https://coolcavemen.com/news/new-website-beta-released/"
    title="New website released as beta version!">
  </a>
  <?php
}

// Call add_corner_banner() method on each template_body_top hook
add_action('template_body_top', 'add_corner_banner');

?>
```

This code tell K2 to replace the `template_body_top` hook define in all K2
pages, by the result of the `add_corner_banner()` PHP function. This function is
coded to return the HTML code we need for the corner banner.

Then we need to add the following CSS code to our style
(`/wp-content/themes/k2/styles/my-style/my-style.css`):

```css
#cornerbanner {
    background: url("/wp-content/themes/k2/styles/my-style/corner-banner.png") no-repeat;
    display: block;
    height: 205px;
    width: 205px;
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    right: 0;
    z-index: 999;
    text-decoration: none;
}
```

This CSS code refer to the
[`corner-banner.png`]({attach}corner-banner.png) which is a 205x205 px PNG
image with an alpha channel to simulate shadows and fine transparency. Here is
the [Gimp `.xcf` source file]({attach}corner-banner.xcf) I used to
generate it.

This CSS code is designed for a top right banner. If you need a top left banner,
replace:

```css
  right: 0;
```

by

```css
  left: 0;
```

This also work for horizontal positioning:

```css
  top: 0;
```

can be replaced by

```css
  bottom: 0;
```

That's all! My solution is not supposed to work (and was not tested) with
Internet Explorer as the latter is known to have
[terrible PNG transparency support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics#Web_browser_support_for_PNG).
You can still apply fixes on my code using
[iepngfix](https://www.twinhelix.com/css/iepngfix/),
[jquery](https://jquery.andreaseberhard.de/pngFix/) or
[PNG8 images](https://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2007/09/18/png8-the-clear-winner/).

I've provided you with all the technical details to create a corner banner and
add it to your K2 style seamlessly. It's now up to you to adapt it to your
needs. Be Creative! Oh, and by the way, when you'll change the banner PNG file,
do not forget to update the CSS code with your image width and height.

**Update**: [my friend QPX](https://wqpx.wordpress.com) sent me an alternative
banner made with photoshop: here is the
[ready-to-use PNG file]({attach}corner-banner-qpx.png) and the
[Photoshop source file]({attach}corner-banner-qpx.psd).
