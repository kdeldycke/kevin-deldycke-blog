In this post I'll show you how I installed Python 2.4 on [Mac OS X Leopard
](https://amzn.com/B000FK88JK/?tag=kevideld-20) and how, starting from a bare
Python environnement, we can build a stand-alone Zope 2.10 instance with Plone
3.2 thanks to `zc.buildout`.

If your goal is to play with or evaluate Plone (or if you don't know what
`zc.buildout` is), then this article will lead you to some troubles and pain.
The Plone community maintain a collection of out-of-the-box and ready-to-use
installers for all major platforms. So before going further, I strongly advise
you to use the [official Plone installer for Mac OS
X](https://plone.org/products/plone). This is much simpler and faster than the
process described below.

Now that all Plone newcomers are redirected to the right place, I can start to
talk about how to install Python 2.4 on Mac OS X. Why the 2.4 release? That's
simple: Mac OS X Leopard ships with Python 2.5, but Plone 3 requires
Python 2.4.

To get Python 2.4 on your machine, you can [install it from its source code
](https://kb.ucla.edu/articles/installing-plone-v32-on-mac-os-x-105). But this
is too much work for me. There should be a way to do it easier and faster...
And there is.

Browsing the net, I found the [repository of the "fat python" project
](https://pythonmac.org/packages/py24-fat/), were you can find a [universal
binary installer for Mac OS X Panther
](https://pythonmac.org/packages/py24-fat/dmg/python-2.4.4-macosx2006-10-18.dmg).
I've just installed it on my brand new Mac OS X 10.5.7 and it seems to works
perfectly:

Now that the most annoying part (to me) is done, we can install Plone via
[`zc.buildout`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout).

Before going further, you need to have a machine that is able to compile code,
which mean [Apple's developer tools
](https://developer.apple.com/technology/tools.html) must be installed locally.
These softwares are available for free on the second DVD that ships with every
Mac OS X copy.

First we create our project directory, then we download, from its SVN
repository, the bootstrap code of buildout:

```shell-session
$ mkdir -p ~/plone-vanilla
$ cd ~/plone-vanilla
$ curl https://svn.zope.org/*checkout*/zc.buildout/trunk/bootstrap/bootstrap.py --output ./bootstrap.py
```

Then we create our buildout config file and edit it:

```shell-session
$ touch ./buildout.cfg
$ vi ./buildout.cfg
```

The `buildout.cfg` file should contain the following directives, which tell
buildout to install Plone 3.2.3, Zope 2.10.8 and all their dependencies:

```ini
[buildout]
find-links = https://dist.plone.org
             https://download.zope.org/ppix
             https://download.zope.org/distribution
             https://effbot.org/downloads
             https://dist.plone.org/release/3.2.3
extends = https://dist.plone.org/release/3.2.3/versions.cfg
versions = versions
parts = zope-server
        zope-instance
eggs = PIL
       Plone

[zope-server]
recipe = plone.recipe.zope2install
url = https://www.zope.org/Products/Zope/2.10.8/Zope-2.10.8-final.tgz
fake-zope-eggs = true
additional-fake-eggs = ZConfig
                       pytz

[zope-instance]
recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
zope2-location = ${zope-server:location}
user = admin:admin
debug-mode = on
verbose-security = on
eggs = ${buildout:eggs}
```

Now let's build our Plone and Zope environnement:

```shell-session
$ python2.4 ./bootstrap.py
$ ./bin/buildout
```

At the end, if your build process didn't fail, you'll be able to start your
Zope server:

```shell-session
$ ./bin/zope-instance
program: /Users/kevin/plone-vanilla/parts/zope-instance/bin/runzope
daemon manager not running
zopectl> start
. daemon process started, pid=17585
zopectl> logtail
------
2009-07-20T20:42:26 INFO ZServer HTTP server started at Mon Jul 20 20:42:26 2009

```

Then you can fire up Safari, go to `http://localhost:8080/manage` (default
Zope config), and login as the `admin` user (password: `admin`):

Create a Plone site:

Check that your using the right version of Plone in the control panel:
