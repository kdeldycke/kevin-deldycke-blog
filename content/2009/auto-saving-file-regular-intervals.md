Here is a way to autosave a file at regular intervals: use `cron`!

The trick is to know that `cron` need percents to be escaped by a backslash in the command zone. For example, here is my crontab entry to create every 10 minutes a local backup of an important project file I currently work on:

```text
*/10 * * * * kevin cp "/home/kevin/Desktop/Projects/Very Important Project/project.file" "/home/kevin/Desktop/Projects/Very Important Project/project.file-backup-`date +\%s`"
```

Quick and dirty, but may saves you precious time on [unstable machines](https://twitter.com/kdeldycke/status/6158072244)! ;)
