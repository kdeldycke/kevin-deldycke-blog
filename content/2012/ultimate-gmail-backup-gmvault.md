For several weeks, I started a quest to find the best solution to locally backup a Gmail account.

I [tried `offline-imap`]({filename}/2012/backup-gmail-offlineimap.md), but it is bidirectional and can push back to your Gmail account local mistakes. Then I [played with `mbsync`]({filename}/2012/gmail-backup-mbsync.md), but it [doesn't support sub-folders/tags](https://www.mail-archive.com/isync-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg00220.html).

I finally found the Holy Grail in [Gmvault](https://gmvault.org/), a recent open-source project especially designed for the task and all its subtleties.

To install it on Ubuntu, starts by getting [distribute](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute), a Python dependency:

```shell-session
$ sudo pip install --upgrade distribute
Downloading/unpacking distribute
  Running setup.py egg_info for package distribute
Installing collected packages: distribute
  Found existing installation: distribute 0.6.24dev-r0
    Uninstalling distribute:

    Before install bootstrap.

Then install Gmvault itself:

```

Now [for authentication, please read the documentation](https://gmvault.org/in_depth.html#authentication). It's quite easy and straightforward.

Finally, to start the backup of your remote Gmail account, just launch:

```shell-session
$ gmvault sync me@example.com --resume
```

All you have to do next is to put the command above in a cron job to trigger a regular backup.
