The goal of that project was to illustrate a pre-recorded soundtrack. The latter being to Cool Cavemen what [The Ecstasy of Gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ecstasy_of_Gold) is to Metallica: a piece that is [played before each show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnX-wK2lVCQ) and serve as concert intro.

It's an original mockup of a radio broadcast, and a tribute to [Classic 21](https://www.rtbf.be/classic21/) ([ex "Radio 21"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_21)), the (best) Belgian radio station we used to listen to as teenagers, and still do.

Footage used to produce this video is public domain material [found at archive.org](https://www.archive.org/details/movies). If you're curious, the detailed list of all sources is available in the credits, at the end of the video.

[As for my previous project]({filename}/2011/nichrome-preview-behind-the-scene-video.md), I have to warn you that it may not look as funny as for French-speaking audience. That being said, here is the final result:

The challenge of this project was to have video of people speaking in sync with the audio. I suffered a lot trying to make it as convincing as possible. If the final result is far from perfect, I find it to be believable enough for the amount of time I invested in.

As for the tools used to produce this video, I edited it in November with a development version of Kdenlive, under an Ubuntu 11.10. As usual, here is a screenshot of my timeline for reference:

The project is using Kdenlive's "NTSC 29.97 fps" profile, which produce a 720x486 pixels stream with a pixel aspect ratio of 8/9 and a display aspect ratio of 4/3. I choose this profile as it was the closest to the original videos I downloaded from archive.org.

I composed the credits and title card in Gimp, and tried to mimic the style of that period. This mean approximative composition and abuse of typography:

To enhance the effect, I blurred everything and separated the text blocks in several layers. I then applied to each of them some random movements to add a parallax effect, thus getting closer to the look and feel produced by the imprecise optical process used in the early days of movie making.
