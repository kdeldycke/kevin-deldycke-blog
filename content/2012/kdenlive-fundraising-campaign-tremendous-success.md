Two months ago [I made a donation to Kdenlive
]({filename}/2012/200-dollars-kdenlive-contribution.md)
fundraising campaign and I just found out that I'm the biggest contributor. And
like other \$100+ contributors, I was offered a place to write a [testimonial
](https://kdenlive.org/fundraising-campaign-2012):

If I won some bragging rights, this is minor news compared to how much the
community participated: the initial goal was set to $4000 but collected funds
ended up at $7419. Almost twice as much as expected! That's were the good news
is: there is no doubt Kdenlive is well supported by a dedicated and generous
community.

It makes me happy as I feel I bet on the right horse when choosing Kdenlive to
edit my humble videos. Long live to Kdenlive! :)
