I've just finished editing the video summary of the [latest Cool Cavemen's concert](https://coolcavemen.com/2011/menu-de-samedi-a-douai/). It's now [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpFqhcihQbw):

That video was mostly shot with my [Canon EOS 7D](https://amzn.com/B002NEGTTW/?tag=kevideld-20) in 1080p at 24fps, with a [Tamron SP AF 17-50mm f/2.8 XR Di-II VC LD IF lens](https://amzn.com/B002LVUIXA/?tag=kevideld-20).

The final video also include footage from various people in the audience:

- Jim from [Maomium](https://maomium.com) tested during the concert its brand new [Sony Alpha SLT-A33](https://amzn.com/B0043AT7AM/?tag=kevideld-20), equipped with a [Sony 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 SAM DT zoom lens](https://amzn.com/B0029U0X0Q/?tag=kevideld-20), which produces nice 1080i streams at 50 fps;

- Lo√Øc filmed in 720p/30fps with [Tomasito](https://coolcavemen.com/biography/tomasito/)'s [Canon PowerShot SX200IS](https://amzn.com/B001SER45Q/?tag=kevideld-20) (which was used to produce [Omashay](https://omashay.com/)'s [_Wish You Looked at Me_ music video]({filename}/2011/making-of-omashay-wish-you-looked-at-me-music-video.md));

- and finally Sylvie shot at 480p/30fps with [Dam](https://coolcavemen.com/biography/dam/)'s point-and-shoot camera, the one he uses for his [guitar cover videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/damdahu/featured).

The video was edited with the latest version of Kdenlive and exported to a 1080p/24fps stream:

If you enjoyed the music and atmosphere of the video, I urge you to go to the [next Cool Cavemen's concert](https://coolcavemen.com/2012/concert-aux-gres-a-douai-le-samedi-7-avril/). And because I know the majority of my readership can't be in the north of France next month, let me remind you there's still a [one hour video of our biggest 2009 concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE-bis-wYxs&list=PL4BAA557B7144031F&feature=plcp) available online (on which I did all the lighting).
