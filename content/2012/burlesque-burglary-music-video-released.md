I've just released my last video project: a music video for [Burlesque Burglary](https://coolcavemen.com/discography/songs-and-lyrics/burlesque-burglary/) by [Cool Cavemen](https://coolcavemen.com). Here is the [official announcement](https://coolcavemen.com/2012/nouveau-clip-video-burlesque-burglary/) on the band website, and here is the video:

It's also the first time I produce subtitles, since I found out about [Subtitle Composer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/subcomposer/) last week, which is a great and simple subtitling software for KDE. This software was so good that I basically [added subtitles](https://twitter.com/#!/coolcavemen/status/160641358762229760) [to all](https://twitter.com/#!/coolcavemen/status/161783153567076352) [Cool Cavemen's video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/coolcavemen) over the week-end. BTW, if you want to contribute to this effort and offer us translation of lyrics and subtitles, send me an email and I'll help you.

I'll try to produce [detailed production notes]({filename}/2012/burlesque-burglary-music-video-production-notes.md) in an upcoming article. So don't forget to subscribe to the [RSS feed of that blog](https://kevin.deldycke.com/feed/) to not miss it! :)

And finally, here are some stills from the video:
