Gmail's content can be retrieved via IMAP, and we'll use this way to backup all
our mails thanks to [OfflineImap](https://offlineimap.org), a generic IMAP
synchronization utility.

Let's start by creating a dedicated configuration file in your home directory.
Its content is quite straight-forward, as you can see in my
`/home/kevin/.offlineimaprc`, which backup two Gmail accounts:

```ini
[general]
accounts = gmail_account1, gmail_account2
maxsyncaccounts = 3
ui = Noninteractive.Basic

[Account gmail_account1]
localrepository = gmail_account1_local
remoterepository = gmail_account1_remote

[Repository gmail_account1_local]
type = Maildir
localfolders = ~/gmail-backup-account1

[Repository gmail_account1_remote]
type = IMAP
remotehost = imap.gmail.com
remoteport = 993
remoteuser = account1@gmail.com
remotepass = XXXXXXXX
ssl = yes
maxconnections = 1
realdelete = no
folderfilter = lambda foldername: foldername not in ['[Gmail]/%s' % f for f in ['All Mail', 'Trash', 'Spam', 'Starred', 'Important']]

[Account gmail_account2]
localrepository = gmail_account2_local
remoterepository = gmail_account2_remote

[Repository gmail_account2_local]
type = Maildir
localfolders = ~/gmail-backup-account2

[Repository gmail_account2_remote]
type = IMAP
remotehost = imap.gmail.com
remoteport = 993
remoteuser = account2@gmail.com
remotepass = XXXXXXXX
ssl = yes
maxconnections = 1
realdelete = no
folderfilter = lambda foldername: foldername not in ['[Gmail]/%s' % f for f in ['All Mail', 'Trash', 'Spam', 'Starred', 'Important']]
```

Notice how we use a Python lambda expressions to [filter
out](https://www.offlineimap.org/doc/nametrans.html#folderfilter) some Gmail's
virtual folders.

Then all you have to do is to launch the `offlineimap` command-line itself with
the right user, for example in a `cron` job:

```text
00 20 * * * kevin offlineimap
```

A final warning: OfflineImap is fully bi-directional. This mean local deletion
propagates to the remote server. This is can be quite dangerous so be careful
not touching your local folders. If for any reason you'd like to reset your
backups, stop OfflineImap processes first, then remove its cache folder
(`~/.offlineimap/`) before removing the local folders themselves
(`~/gmail-backup-account*`).

Also, intensively playing with OfflineImap to adjust its configuration may
trigger the infamous Gmail's `Temporary Error 500`. In this case don't panic:
it seems to be a common Gmail's auto-immune response against suspect activity.
It happened to me and in the end my account and mails were safe: I just had to
wait a few hours to let it resume normal operations.
