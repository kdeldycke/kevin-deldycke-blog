I [just donated
\$200](https://twitter.com/#!/kdeldycke/status/182018605259567104) to the
[Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org) project, as they have [just
started](https://web.archive.org/web/20160318001247/https://kdenlive.org/users/ttill/kdenlive-fundraising-campaign)
a [fundraising
campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/kdenlive-refactoring) to refactor
its core and make it future-proof:

The amount of collected funds is currently at $3,041 from the $4,000 required
to pay a developer to work full-time for 2 months. With only \$959 remaining and
41 days left, you have no reason to not contribute to the best open-source
video editor out there.

I started to play with Kdenlive several years ago with version 0.3. I even
[created some RPM
packages](https://github.com/kdeldycke/mandriva-specs)
back then. Kdenlive suffered from heavy instabilities in its early days.

But this was a long time ago and today itâ€™s the most stable and practical video
editing software available on Linux. It's the best open-source tool for amateur
DSLR shooters, and is worth a try even if your primary desktop manager is not
KDE.

Today this software is the one I spend most of my time in at home (just after a
web browser and a command-line terminal). And I've never felt as productive as
the last 2 years: I [edited about 2 hours of
videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL95D32FAA4D6FD6A5) in that
period.

Kdenlive must continue to grow. And because I want to use it in my future
projects, it makes sense to make a donation. So what are you waiting for
contributing too? :)
