One week ago I succeed to install the Sun's Java Runtime Environment (JRE) on my Mandriva 2006. I avoid to use proprietary software as long as I can. Unfortunately I needed it to fill my annual tax form online...

So, here is how I achieve this:

1. [Download the last JRE](https://jdl.sun.com/webapps/download/AutoDL?BundleId=10335) (v1.5.0-06 at that time) from [Sun official website](https://java.com/download).

1. As root, launch:

   ```shell-session
   $ sh ./jre-1_5_0_06-linux-i586-rpm.bin
   ```

   (name of the file can change depending of the version number).

1. Accept the licence (tip: scroll down until the end of the text).

1. Back to the console, run:

   ```shell-session
   $ urpmi ./jre-1_5_0_06-linux-i586.rpm
   ```

1. Go to mozilla system-wide plugin directory:

   ```shell-session
   $ cd /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins
   ```

1. Create a symlink to the java plugin file:

   ```shell-session
   $ ln -s /usr/java/jre1.5.0_06/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so
   ```

1. Finished!

To check that java is well installed, type `about:plugins` in your Firefox browser URL field and check that java plug-in appear on the list.

Happy tax form filling!
