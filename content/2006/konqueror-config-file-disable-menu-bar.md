To disable the menu bar in [konqueror](https://www.konqueror.org), you have a specific action in menus. If you want to do this by hand, just add the following directive in your `~/.kde/share/config/konquerorrc` file:

```ini
[KonqMainWindow]
MenuBar=Disabled
```

This tip is interesting because you can also apply it for any KDE application that doesn't support this feature.

For example, in [kmail](https://kmail.kde.org), you can add the "`MenuBar=Disabled`" statement in "`[Main Window]`" section: this will have the same effect as in konqueror.
