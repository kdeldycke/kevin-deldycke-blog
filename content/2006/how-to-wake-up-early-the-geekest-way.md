![Mobile Phone, Broken Screen]({attach}pict4644.jpg)

I was in a country far far away last month. So far that there was no broadband access (yes, this is possible). Anyway... Generally I use my mobile phone as a clock and as an alarm clock. Unfortunalty I brake it down just before my night flight.

So, to simplify, I was abroad in a hotel, the sun was down since a while, I was tired, and I had to wake up early. No electronic devices to help me, except my laptop... And then came the idea to combine `cron` and `mplayer` to automaticcaly play some MP3s at a given time.

Here is how I've done it. First, as `root`, create an empty file in `/etc/cron.d/`. Let us call it `wake-up`:

```shell-session
$ touch /etc/cron.d/wake-up
```

Then edit it to put the following command:

```text
15 6 * * * root mplayer /home/kevin/music/CoolCavemen/AllCoolHits/*.flac > /dev/null 2>&1 /dev/null
```

This mean that mplayer will be launched at 6:15 and will play all FLAC files from the `/home/kevin/music/CoolCavemen/AllCoolHits/` directory. I let you adapt those parameters to fit your needs.

_Random Tips:_

- Take care of time zone (system time and local time are very different).

- Check that your volume is not muted and crank the volume up!

- Run the `mplayer /home/kevin/music/CoolCavemen/AllCoolHits/*.flac > /dev/null 2>&1 /dev/null` command alone in another terminal before you go to sleep to be sure it work (i.e. to check that all sound-related sub-systems are loaded).

- Be sure that cron deamon is up an running (do a `/etc/init.d/crond restart` if you are not sure).
