![]({attach}e107-to-wordpress-061.png) Here is the [version 0.6 of my tool to import e107 content in Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/e107-importer/). Comparing to [v0.5]({filename}/2006/wordpress-to-e107-v05-static-pages-import-added.md), this 6th alpha version render content as it is rendered in e107 thanks to the use of user's website preferences. This release also handle news extended part nicely (look at [screenshot]({attach}e107-to-wordpress-06.png)

), and is built to work with the [latest e107 v0.7.6](https://e107.org/news.php?item.799.1) and [Wordpress 2.0.5](https://wordpress.org/development/2006/10/205-ronan/).
