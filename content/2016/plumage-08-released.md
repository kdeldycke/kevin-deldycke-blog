I just released version 0.8 of my [Plumage
theme](https://github.com/kdeldycke/plumage) for Pelican.

Main change is the removal of `grabicon.com` in favor of the free [Favicon
Finder](https://icons.better-idea.org) web service, and clean-up around the
google analytics tracking code. Both changes may require some minor adjustments
in your config.

For more details, see the [changelog
](https://github.com/kdeldycke/plumage/blob/main/changelog.md#080-2016-06-22).
