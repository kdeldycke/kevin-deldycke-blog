Just released [`maildir-deduplicate`
v1.1.0](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/maildir-deduplicate/1.1.0)!

Major change is, in addition of Python 2.7, support of Python 3.4 and 3.5.
Because of the low unit-test coverage I'm not certain it is properly working on
Python 3.x. So please [send me
pull-requests](https://github.com/kdeldycke/maildir-deduplicate) to improve the
situation. I'm not going to be picky: I'll be happy to merge them right away!
