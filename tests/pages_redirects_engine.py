"""A faithful Python replica of the engine Cloudflare Pages runs ``_redirects`` on.

Cloudflare's documentation describes the file format; it does not describe the
accounting, and the accounting is where this blog lost half its redirects for years.
This module replicates the reference implementation so the test suite can audit the
file the way production will read it, before production reads it.

Transcribed on 2026-08-10 from the engine itself, not from the documentation:

- Parsing: ``packages/workers-shared/utils/configuration/parseRedirects.ts`` in
  [cloudflare/workers-sdk](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk), as bundled in
  wrangler 4.118 (the same code path Miniflare uses, and the same parser family the
  Pages asset server feeds on).
- Matching: ``packages/workers-shared/asset-worker/src/utils/rules-engine.ts``.

The three rules of the engine that the documentation does not state:

1. **A static rule is only free while it appears before the first dynamic rule.**
   The parser flips ``canCreateStaticRule`` to false permanently at the first source
   containing ``*`` or ``:placeholder``. Every later rule, however static it looks,
   is charged against the dynamic budget.
2. **The dynamic budget is 100, and blowing it aborts the file.** Rule 101 of that
   mixed stream does not get skipped: the parser ``break``s, discarding every
   remaining line. Order is therefore not a style choice, it decides which rules
   exist.
3. **Matching is anchored and literal about trailing slashes.** A placeholder
   compiles to ``[^/]+`` (at least one character, never a slash), a splat to ``.*``
   (may be empty), and the whole source to ``^...$``. ``/a/:b`` does not match
   ``/x/y/`` and ``/a/*`` matches ``/a/`` with an empty splat.
