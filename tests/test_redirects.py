"""Validate ``content/extra/_redirects`` the way production will actually read it.

Two layers, and both are needed:

- **Offline**, against the engine replica in ``pages_redirects_engine``: the file
  must survive parsing whole. Cloudflare's parser silently discards rules past its
  budgets and the deploy pipeline surfaces none of it, so this suite is the only
  place a regression can fail loudly before it ships. This is where the file's
  statics-first contract is enforced.
- **Online**, against the live site: one request per rule, expectations computed by
  the same replica. Production is the referee; the replica only predicts it.
